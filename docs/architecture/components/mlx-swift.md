# MLX stack: the three pinned submodules and the metallib

> Last updated: 2026-09-27 · commit `a2ec0da03`

What the provider links from `libs/`, at which commits, what each submodule
contributes, how the Metal kernel library (`mlx.metallib`) is built from the
same source and pinned at runtime, and what the provider actually takes from the
upstream `MLXLMServer` library. Build steps live in
[`../../developer/build.md`](../../developer/build.md); the serving path in
[`../inference.md`](../inference.md).

## Context

The provider is one Swift package (`provider-swift/Package.swift`) whose
`ProviderCore` target links the MLX array framework and the language-model
libraries as **local path dependencies** — `.package(path: "../libs/mlx-swift")`
and `.package(path: "../libs/mlx-swift-lm")` — so every MLX byte in a build
comes from the git submodule commits the superproject pins. Nothing about MLX
is fetched at build time: `provider-swift/Package.resolved` has no `mlx-swift`
or `mlx-swift-lm` entry, and `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Package.swift`'s own
`Layr-Labs/mlx-swift.git` (`branch: "main"`) dependency resolves to the root
package's path dependency of the same identity.

## Mechanism

### The pinned submodules

`.gitmodules` declares three submodules, all Layr-Labs forks. The pin is the
gitlink in the superproject tree; read it with `git ls-tree HEAD libs/`:

| Submodule | Fork | Pinned commit | What the provider gets from it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `libs/mlx-swift` | `Layr-Labs/mlx-swift` | `67153a874b6d8dd0e1ad04c256298eaae8249cd7` | `MLX` (arrays, lazy evaluation, Metal device) and `MLXNN`; its `Cmlx` target compiles the C++ core from the **nested** submodules `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx` (`30ae6560`) and `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx-c` (`3ccef14`) — the tree the metallib is built from |
| `libs/mlx-swift-lm` | `Layr-Labs/mlx-swift-lm` | `a486a55d032deae001190bf9795ece1cb3d9a609` | `MLXLMCommon` (model loading, tokenizer integration, ContinuousBatchingV2 engine, tool-call formats), `MLXLLM` and `MLXVLM` (model implementations), `MLXLMServer` (OpenAI request types, tool and reasoning parsers, local HTTP router) |
| `libs/mlx` | `Layr-Labs/mlx` (`branch = main`) | `0a725e3000edabc4911cde345270ca950bfa152f` | A separate checkout of the C++ core. Neither `provider-swift/Package.swift`, `Makefile`, `scripts/`, nor `.github/` reads it; bumping it alone changes no provider bytes (`CLAUDE.md`) |

A bump is a superproject commit that moves a gitlink (check out the new commit
inside the submodule, `git add libs/<name>`); the checkout procedure is step 1
of [`../../developer/build.md`](../../developer/build.md). Engine facts in the
architecture pages are read at the pinned `libs/mlx-swift-lm` commit.

### Coherent allocator accounting

`Memory.snapshot()` captures active, cached and peak allocator bytes under one
native allocator lock through `mlx_get_memory_snapshot`. It does not synchronize
streams or measure process RSS. Allocations enter the counters at their existing
registration step, so admission must keep provisional promises until the owning
allocation is evaluated and accounted. The call can wait behind allocator work;
initialize the allocator before taking a process admission lock.

Implementation: `libs/mlx-swift/Source/MLX/Memory.swift` (`snapshot`),
`libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/memory.h` (`get_memory_snapshot`). CPU, Metal,
C-bridge checks and limits are recorded in
[`../../reports/2026-09-05-coherent-memory-snapshot.md`](../../reports/2026-09-05-coherent-memory-snapshot.md).

### Allocator footprint and backing ownership

`Memory.allocationFootprintUpperBound(byteCount:)` computes a checked upper
bound for one backing under the existing allocator rounding and cache-reuse
rules. It does not allocate, inspect the cache or submit stream work.
`MLXArray.evaluatedBufferInfo()` observes available allocator bytes, offset,
elements, contiguity and instantaneous uniqueness without evaluating or waiting.
Neither API grants ownership or prices an entire graph.

`Memory.allocationFootprintPolicy()` returns the backend's immutable sizing
parameters. The value's `upperBound(byteCount:)` and `maximumExtraBytes` perform
checked arithmetic without allocator access, locks, allocation or callbacks;
invalid or overflowing projections return nil. Admission can price independent
future buffers with this value. It does not inspect available cache entries or
reserve memory. The throwing prediction API uses the same arithmetic. See the
[policy validation](../../reports/2026-09-05-allocator-policy.md).

Native paged construction holds its provisional charge before allocation and
drains the captured stream after successful or throwing evaluation. Completion
handlers can retain data references after `eval` returns. Only a fresh exclusive
full backing earns materialization coverage; its shared owner survives rebasing,
and staged/growth charges settle to actual backing bytes. Metadata observation
itself never synchronizes a stream or credits an alias.

Implementation: `libs/mlx-swift/Source/MLX/AllocationFootprint.swift`,
`libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/memory.h`
(`get_allocation_size_upper_bound`) and
`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/ContinuousBatchingV2/Paged/PagedKVSegments.swift`
(`PagedKVSegmentBacking`). CPU, Metal, Swift and native validation, including
failure corrections and pending provider/whole-graph work, are recorded in
[the allocator report](../../reports/2026-09-05-allocator-footprint.md).

### What `ProviderCore` links

| Product | Package (`provider-swift/Package.swift`) | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `MLX`, `MLXNN` | `mlx-swift` (path) | Arrays, Metal backend, layers |
| `MLXLLM`, `MLXVLM`, `MLXLMCommon`, `MLXLMServer` | `mlx-swift-lm` (path) | Models, CBv2 engine, request types and parsers |
| `Transformers` | `swift-transformers` `from: "1.3.0"` | First release whose `TokenizerModel.knownTokenizers` includes `TokenizersBackend`, the tokenizer class of Qwen 3.5 / Qwen3-VL checkpoints |
| `Jinja` | `swift-jinja` `exact: "2.3.6"` (also linked by `ProviderCoreFoundation`) | `TemplateRenderCheck` compiles chat templates with the exact engine the runtime tokenizer uses |
| `Hummingbird` | `hummingbird` `exact: "2.23.0"` | Matches the `from: "2.23.0"` that `MLXLMServer` declares |

Platform floor: `provider-swift/Package.swift` and `libs/mlx-swift-lm/Package.swift`
both declare `.macOS(.v14)`; `libs/mlx-swift/Package.swift` declares no
`platforms:` at all. There is no runtime macOS-version gate — `darkbloom doctor`
only warns below `recommendedMacOSMajorVersion`, whose value is in
[`../hardware-support.md#constants`](../hardware-support.md#constants).

### What `MLXLMServer` is used for

The provider does not run the upstream inference server. Generation goes
`MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngine` → `EngineV2Bridge` → `EngineV2` (CBv2), and
`MLXLMServer` contributes contracts and parsers around that path:

| Provider code | `MLXLMServer` symbols used |
|---|---|
| `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Scheduler/MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngine.swift` | Conforms to `MLXServerEngine`; consumes the OpenAI `ChatCompletionRequest` types; resolves tool parsers with `ServerToolParser.resolve` |
| `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop.swift` | `ReasoningParser`, `ReasoningParserFormat` (`inferReasoningParser`) |
| `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Server/StandaloneServer+HTTP.swift`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Server/LocalInferenceHTTP.swift`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Server/LocalChatUploadResponder.swift` | `MLXServerApplication` router, `MLXOpenAIService`, `InMemoryResponseStore`, `ServerMetrics`, `OpenAIErrorEnvelope` — the local / standalone OpenAI-compatible HTTP surface, served by the same `MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngine` |

The upstream `MLXModelContainerEngine` (the server's own generation engine) is
never instantiated by the provider.

### The source-matched metallib

SwiftPM does not compile the `Cmlx` target's Metal shaders, so the kernels
ship as a separate `mlx.metallib` that must match the compiled C++ exactly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S[libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx] -- cmake, deployment target MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET --> M[mlx.metallib beside the binary]
    M -- locateRuntimeMetallib --> C[mlx.metallib, then Resources/mlx.metallib]
    C -- makeRuntimeMetallibSnapshot: copy to unlinked fd + SHA-256 --> A[/dev/fd/N snapshot]
    A -- darkbloom_mlx_set_metallib_path --> MLX[MLX loader, before the first GPU op]
    A -- digest --> H[template_hashes.mlx_metallib in RuntimeHashes]
```

- **Build.** `scripts/fetch-metallib.sh` cmake-builds the kernels from
  `MLX_SRC = libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx`, with a
  `MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` default high enough that the `_nax`
  kernels are compiled, and refuses a library missing any symbol of its
  `COMPLETENESS_CONTRACT` (`_nax`, `gemv`, the Gemma 4 expert-tile builders
  and the `affine_qmv_wide_*` kernels). Default, invocation and cache knobs:
  [`../../developer/build.md#5-provider-cli-swift-with-source-matched-metallib`](../../developer/build.md#5-provider-cli-swift-with-source-matched-metallib).
- **Locate.** MLX's C++ loader tries the colocated `mlx.metallib` before
  `Resources/mlx.metallib` (`load_colocated_library`,
  `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/backend/metal/device.cpp`);
  `locateRuntimeMetallib` mirrors exactly that order relative to the running
  executable and ignores `MLX_METALLIB_PATH`, which MLX does not read
  (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/BinaryHasher.swift`).
- **Pin.** `bindRuntimeMetallibForMLX` copies the located file into an
  unlinked open descriptor while hashing it (`makeRuntimeMetallibSnapshot`) and
  points MLX at `/dev/fd/N` through `darkbloom_mlx_set_metallib_path`
  (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderMetallibControl/ProviderMetallibControl.cpp`).
  `ServeRuntimePreparer` and `StartCommand` do this before any Metal probe
  (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServeRuntimePreparer.swift`); rebinding
  with a different source or different bytes fails closed
  (`RuntimeMetallibBindingError`).
- **Report.** The snapshot digest is added to the runtime hashes as
  `template_hashes["mlx_metallib"]` (`augmentRuntimeHashesWithMetallib`,
  `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+Serve.swift`).

## Invariants

1. Every MLX byte in a build comes from the pinned gitlinks: both MLX packages
   are path dependencies and `provider-swift/Package.resolved` carries no MLX
   entry — `provider-swift/Package.swift`.
2. The metallib is compiled from the same tree the `Cmlx` target compiles —
   `scripts/fetch-metallib.sh` (`MLX_SRC`).
3. MLX loads only the anonymous snapshot bound before the first GPU
   operation; replacing the colocated file afterwards cannot change loaded
   kernels — `BinaryHasher.swift` (`makeRuntimeMetallibSnapshot`,
   `bindRuntimeMetallibForMLX`).
4. The digest the coordinator sees describes the inode MLX loaded, not a
   pathname — `BinaryHasher.swift` (`RuntimeMetallibSnapshot`),
   `ProviderLoop+Serve.swift`.
5. Generation never runs through an upstream `MLXLMServer` engine —
   `MultiModelBatchSchedulerEngine.swift` implements `MLXServerEngine` over
   `EngineV2Bridge`.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `swift build` succeeds, Metal work fails at start | No `mlx.metallib` beside the executable (or under `Resources/`) | `BinaryHasher.swift` (`locateRuntimeMetallib`); fix: [`../../developer/build.md`](../../developer/build.md) |
| `fetch-metallib.sh` fails on a missing `_nax` symbol | Built with a deployment target below the `MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` default or an SDK without Metal 4 | `scripts/fetch-metallib.sh` (`COMPLETENESS_CONTRACT`) |
| Bumping `libs/mlx` changes nothing | The compiled core is `libs/mlx-swift/Source/Cmlx/mlx`, a different gitlink | `CLAUDE.md`, `scripts/fetch-metallib.sh` |
| Qwen 3.5 load fails with `.unsupportedTokenizer("TokenizersBackend")` | `swift-transformers` below `1.3.0` | `provider-swift/Package.swift` |
| Metallib rebind refused | Second bind with a different source or digest | `BinaryHasher.swift` (`RuntimeMetallibBindingError`) |
