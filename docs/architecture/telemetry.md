# Telemetry

> Last updated: 2026-09-29 · commit `f8215f8c7`

How operational data leaves a provider, what the coordinator does with it, and
why nothing on that path can carry a prompt or slow a request. The heartbeat is
the diagnostic channel; Datadog is the sink; the coordinator is the only
process that emits telemetry *events*. The field-by-field catalogue is in
[`../reference/telemetry-inventory.md`](../reference/telemetry-inventory.md)
and the event contract in [`../reference/telemetry-schema.md`](../reference/telemetry-schema.md).

Per-attempt prediction/refusal evidence travels on existing terminal profiles
to PostgreSQL, separately from telemetry events. Its
[field reference](../reference/prediction-decision-telemetry.md) describes the
closed values, timing boundaries and rollout. Optional `unbounded_reason`
separates engine projection failure families without changing admission.
The coordinator stores only recognized closed values or `other`, while
older reasonless records remain absent.

## Context

Providers run on machines the project does not own, next to prompts the
project must never see. The first telemetry design gave every client (Swift
provider, console, app) a free-form event API posted to
`POST /v1/telemetry/events`, sanitized and stored by the coordinator.
That path is retired: the coordinator no longer registers the route (a stale
client gets a plain 404), the Swift `TelemetryClient` and console
`telemetry.ts` are no-op facades, and the `telemetry_events` table is gone. What replaced it is narrower and structural:

- the **heartbeat** already carries every operational fact the coordinator
  needs (status, slot capacity, engine health, GPU memory, allocator counters),
  in a typed shape with no free-text fields except the bounded
  `kv_backend_fallback_reason`;
- the **coordinator** emits its own events about provider connections and
  dispatch failures, from code the project controls;
- **per-request rows** (`inference_routes`, `request_rejections`,
  `request_profiles`) and the profiler's `profile` object hold request-level
  timing without any request content.

The event shape survives because it still bounds the coordinator emitter, and
because reviving ingestion would have to start from it. There is no server-side
field allowlist any more: with nothing ingesting client events, it filtered
nothing. The privacy guarantee rests on there being no client ingestion path at
all and on the emitter's call sites passing fixed operational keys.

## Mechanism

### Heartbeat telemetry

```
provider (every heartbeat_interval_secs, event heartbeats ≤ 2/s)
  → GET /ws/provider frame `heartbeat`
  → providerReadLoop            validate prefix-cache telemetry; reject → routing.cache_telemetry_rejected
  → Registry.Heartbeat          clamp system_metrics to [0,1]; canonicalHeartbeatModelState → clampBackendCapacity;
                                 drop stale capacity_seq (only LastHeartbeat advances); delta-merge stats
  → BackendCapacitySnapshot     the accepted, clamped copy
  → recordBackendWedgeTelemetry provider.first_token_wedge_suspected{model}, provider.eval_in_flight_long
  → recordMLXCacheTelemetry     provider.mlx_memory.*{chip_family,provider_version}, provider.mlx_cache.*{chip_family,provider_version}
  → PersistProviderThrottled    providers / provider_reputation rows, at most every 30 s
```

The baseline cadence is the provider's `heartbeat_interval_secs` ([CLI reference](../provider/cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli)).

Metrics are emitted only from the accepted registry snapshot, never from the
raw frame: values have been clamped (`maxDecodeTPS = 500`, `maxPrefillTPS =
20000`, `maxReportedMaxConcurrency = 24`, …) and slot model IDs constrained to
the connection's coordinator-known inventory. Every 60 s the fleet sampler
(`StartProfilerLoops`) turns the same snapshots into `fleet_snapshots` rows
through the real routing gates; every 15 s `StartDDGaugeLoop` pushes the
platform gauges (`providers.online`, `utilization.*`, `capacity.*`,
`request_queue.depth`). How the scheduler reads the capacity fields:
[`scheduling.md`](scheduling.md); the gate vocabulary: [`routing.md`](routing.md).

Optional per-engine performance observations carry an epoch, sample count and
age independently of heartbeat cadence. Prompt measurements are published before
terminal accounting, and engine decode capacity stays separate from delivered
streaming/end-to-end rates. See the exact [capacity protocol](../reference/protocol-messages.md#slotsperformance_measurements)
and `coordinator/registry/performance_measurements.go`. These fields belong to
in-memory routing observations and are excluded from persisted numeric-only
provider telemetry; they add no client telemetry-ingestion endpoint.
The first-content design includes coarse numeric workload buckets for
routing: these reveal bounded workload-size metadata to the coordinator, which
already processes the request, but contain no prompt text, completion text,
token IDs, media or cache keys. The protocol accepts only six fixed numeric
bucket ceilings and closed phase/cache/contention values, with at most 32
engine-local aggregate buckets. Warm-pool planning retains numeric work means
in memory; process logs and event emitters omit the measured prompt/output
means and work rates.

`recordMLXCacheTelemetry` emits allocator snapshots as histograms with a
DogStatsD-only client, or as latest-value gauges through HTTPS when
`DD_API_KEY` is configured (`coordinator/datadog/metrics_snapshot.go`,
`HistogramOrGauge`). HTTPS gauges preserve snapshot visibility without
claiming fleet percentiles. It emits
cumulative reclaimer counters as nonnegative deltas from the previous accepted
heartbeat. The first observation has no counter baseline; a reset contributes
no negative delta (`coordinator/api/provider_mlx_cache_telemetry.go`).
`applyProviderHeartbeat` (`coordinator/api/provider_heartbeat.go`) emits only
when `Registry.Heartbeat` accepts the snapshot; stale sequence-stamped frames
still prove liveness but emit no repeated allocator or wedge samples. Tags
never include a provider session id. `sanitizeChipFamilyTag` uses the fixed
M1–M5 family/tier vocabulary plus `unknown`/`other`; client-cancellation metrics
use the same helper (`coordinator/api/chip_family_tags.go`).
`sanitizeVersionTag` maps strict semver to `0.6.x`, `0.7.x`, `0.8.x`, `0.9.x`,
`other_release`, or `prerelease`; missing values are `unknown`, invalid values
are `other` (`coordinator/api/unknown_frame_metrics.go`). Arbitrary patch
numbers and prerelease counters cannot create new series. Exact versions
remain in provider metadata.

### Slot posture sampler lifecycle

`EngineV2Bridge.configureMTPStatus` in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Bridge/EngineV2Bridge+MTP.swift` emits
the opening slot-posture sample synchronously and starts a periodic task. Periodic delivery rechecks task
cancellation inside the bridge actor, after the scheduling hop; cancellation
while queued cannot emit a stale sample. `EngineV2Bridge.shutdown` cancels and
joins the sampler before returning
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/Bridge/EngineV2Bridge+Lifecycle.swift`). This preserves the opening observation while
preventing the periodic producer from emitting after teardown.

### Durable prefix-cache observations

`startSSDPrefixCacheStatsLogger`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/EngineV2Bridge+SSDPrefixCache.swift`)
selects the store actually accepted by the bridge, captures one typed numeric
snapshot immediately, then refreshes at the existing stats cadence. The
`SSDPrefixCacheTelemetryBox` retains only that observation and its monotonic
capture time; capacity refresh attaches it as `slots[].prefix_cache` with an
updated age. Whole-root maintenance contributes three process counters through
`ProviderLoop+Capacity.swift`, including removals from unloaded models. The
[wire reference](../reference/protocol-messages.md#slotsprefix_cache) defines the
fields; no free-form client event transport is used. One counter originates in
the engine rather than the store: when a packed prefill cohort disarms a
recurrent donor's checkpoint capture, `EngineLoopV2` reports it once per
request through `CBv2CompletePrefixCache.recordRecurrentCaptureDisarmed(packedAt:)`,
`SSDHybridCheckpointStore` counts it in its stats, and the snapshot carries it
as `recurrent_capture_disarmed_packed_total` (complete-checkpoint stores only).

`applyProviderHeartbeat` feeds only registry-accepted snapshots to
`recordPrefixCacheTelemetry` (`coordinator/api/provider_prefix_cache_telemetry.go`),
which emits the store-lifetime counters as positive deltas
(`provider.prefix_cache.recurrent_capture_disarmed_packed` among them; a
provider that omits the optional field contributes no delta and seeds a
baseline when the field first appears).
The existing live slot snapshot is the entire counter baseline: a new cache
generation seeds it, removal or missing telemetry clears it, and disconnect
ends the provider lifetime. Repeated sample sequences cannot contribute another
observation or delta; their age still advances, including on the coordinator's
clock. Samples older than five minutes emit age/freshness diagnostics only.
Counters that move backwards contribute no negative delta. Cumulative stage
and write microseconds become counter deltas, while per-request `cache_stage_ms`
remains the latency measurement. Tags are closed cache kind plus existing
bounded chip/version classes; model, generation, prompt and cache identities
never become new metric labels.

Complete-checkpoint donations now settle the existing bounded
`prefix_cache_donation_outcomes` counter once per exported endpoint, including
synchronous refusal, queue overflow, shutdown, write failure and already-durable
success (`SSDHybridCheckpointStore+Write.swift`, `PrefixCacheDonationTelemetry.swift`).
Complete-checkpoint outcomes distinguish host-memory refusal, stale epoch,
maintenance contention, low disk space, unsafe root, fresh-write I/O error,
unreadable existing file and post-write eviction. Error descriptions and paths
never become metric labels. The legacy `write_failed` still covers unclassified
producer errors and older providers, so it must not be interpreted as a count
of physical disk errors.

The complete-checkpoint writer also distinguishes novel-share exhaustion
(`write_priority_limited`) from total-budget exhaustion (`write_rate_limited`)
through `SSDWriteRateLimiter.decision`. Ahead of both, the demand gate settles
`skipped_novel` for a checkpoint with no coordinator-observed or local repeat
demand, spending no bytes or budget (`SSDCheckpointDemand.admitsWrite`). All
three settle the same typed heartbeat counter; none creates a new event field. The [protocol reference](../reference/protocol-messages.md)
owns the closed outcome vocabulary, and the [SSD reference](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules)
defines the write policy.

A failed atomic creation that never entered the index does not revoke unrelated
checkpoints: the next donation can retry after the failure clears. Failure to
reauthenticate an indexed file still removes that file under an epoch change
before any ready receipt can be published. Cancellation and stale-epoch work
publish no receipt and do not revoke a newer epoch's evidence
(`SSDHybridCheckpointStore.performWrite`). There is no unbounded retry loop or
retained failed tensor job.
The complete-store `donation_drops_total` counter covers queued-write
`writesDropped` only; prequeue refusals are counted by the donation outcome
snapshot. Maintenance publishes its cumulative result under a separate short
stats lock, so heartbeat reads cannot wait behind filesystem traversal.
The write-job settlement releases its source before the callback. The engine's
later donor-release fence still governs READY; telemetry never manufactures a
holder receipt. Whole-root removal counters and active-store budget evictions
have separate scopes and must not be interpreted as two measurements of the
same sweep.

### Paged allocator observations

The optional [paged-storage wire object](../reference/protocol-messages.md#slotspaged_storage)
keeps native ownership and allocator refusals separate from SSD storage and
request timing. `PagedKVPool.segmentStorageSnapshot` captures ownership, native
refusal counters, pool identity and a monotonic timestamp on the engine queue.
`PagedStorageTelemetryAdapter` copies this immutable value into the heartbeat,
without allocator traversal or refreshing its age. Grant-only point updates
change the separate live capacity fields and leave the allocator capture intact. `reconcileCapacitySamples`
(`coordinator/registry/capacity_sample_freshness.go`) shares the prefix-cache
age/replay rule, so a continuing heartbeat cannot freshen a stalled producer.
Only the current live slot snapshot holds the baseline; no pool-generation
history grows across reloads. A separate coordinator timestamp advances only
with accepted capacity replacements; rejected capacity frames can prove
liveness without erasing elapsed sample age.

`recordPagedStorageTelemetry` (`coordinator/api/provider_paged_storage_telemetry.go`)
publishes bounded chip/version-tagged observations after registry acceptance.
Actual segment ownership includes allocator padding. The optional padding
gauge identifies bytes that cannot hold KV pages; usable slack excludes them.
The optional last-allocation allowance gauge records conservative reservation
bytes released after a successful preparation, rather than retained memory
(`PagedStorageTelemetryCapture`,
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/PagedStorageTelemetryAdapter.swift`).
Ownership gauges overlap and must not be summed. Failure/refusal totals become
positive deltas within one generation; the first sample and reload seed a
baseline. Stale samples expose their age instead of new ownership measurements.
These fields are available in backend snapshots and Datadog; they are not new
`fleet_snapshots` columns, admission inputs, or durable-cache holder evidence.

### Process memory observations

`ProcessMemoryTelemetrySampler` captures the process ledger's coherent
ownership and allocator snapshot during the provider capacity refresh
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/ProcessMemoryTelemetrySampler.swift`).
The [wire object](../reference/protocol-messages.md#backend_capacitytelemetryprocess_memory)
reports outstanding promises as charged bytes minus covered materialized bytes.
Operators can distinguish active allocations, reserved future memory, and debt
without adding overlapping ownership gauges together.

Heartbeat stamping ages this immutable observation without advancing its producer
sequence (`CoordinatorClientState.stampAndPublishHeartbeatCapacity`). Registry
reconciliation preserves age across repeated captures even with zero loaded slots.
`recordProcessMemoryTelemetry` (`coordinator/api/provider_process_memory_telemetry.go`)
emits fresh observations with bounded chip/version tags; stale observations emit
age and freshness only. No owner IDs, model names, request contents, or generation
values become metric labels. The object remains diagnostic: process admission
continues to use its local ledger, and cache routing consumes durable checkpoint
evidence and service cost.

### Datadog transport

`datadog.Client` (`coordinator/datadog/datadog.go`) is constructed in
`coordinator/cmd/coordinator/main.go` only when `DD_API_KEY` or `DD_AGENT_HOST`
is set; otherwise `s.dd` is nil and every `ddIncr`/`ddGauge`/`ddHistogram`
(`coordinator/api/server.go`) is a no-op. Configuration is environment only —
`DD_API_KEY`, `DD_AGENT_HOST`, `DD_DOGSTATSD_URL`, `DD_SITE`, `DD_ENV`, `DD_SERVICE`,
`DD_HOSTNAME` — with defaults under [configuration](../reference/configuration.md#telemetry-datadog-and-profiling).
`DD_API_KEY` enables the HTTPS paths (series, logs, events); `DD_AGENT_HOST` alone still
constructs the client and starts the tracer.

Metric names in this page omit the Datadog namespace prefix (`statsd.WithNamespace`;
owner: [telemetry-inventory](../reference/telemetry-inventory.md#coordinator-derived-datadog-metrics)).
Which leg carries a metric depends on kind and on whether an API key is set
(`httpMetrics`):

| Kind | `DD_API_KEY` unset | `DD_API_KEY` set |
|---|---|---|
| counter, gauge | DogStatsD UDP, best effort | buffered in `seriesBuffer` and POSTed to `https://api.<site>/api/v1/series` every 5 s (`metrics_http.go`); the DogStatsD leg is skipped so an agent appearing later cannot double-count |
| histogram | DogStatsD UDP | DogStatsD UDP only — percentiles are aggregated agent-side and the HTTPS path does not replicate them |
| telemetry event log | dropped | batched (100 or 5 s) to `https://http-intake.logs.<site>/api/v2/logs`; `fatal` also posts a Datadog Event (`emitDDEvent`) for monitors |

The HTTPS series path is therefore a **replacement** for the UDP leg when a key
is present, not a fallback behind it.

### Coordinator events and logs

`Emitter.Emit` (`coordinator/telemetry/emitter.go`) forces `source =
coordinator`, defaults `kind` to `custom` and `severity` to `info`, then writes
to three sinks in order: `slog` (`telemetry: <message>` with every field as an
attribute), the in-process counter `telemetry_events_total{source, severity,
kind}` (`GET /v1/admin/metrics`), and the Datadog Logs API. The call sites
(`s.emit`, `s.emitRequest`, `s.emitPanic`) are enumerated in the
[inventory](../reference/telemetry-inventory.md#coordinator-emitted-events).

Logging is JSON to stdout (`slog.NewJSONHandler`). When Datadog is configured
the handler is wrapped in `datadog.TraceHandler` (`coordinator/datadog/slog.go`),
which adds `dd.trace_id` and `dd.span_id` to any record whose context carries
an active APM span, and `ddtracer.Start` runs for the process lifetime. No
coordinator code creates spans at this commit, so those attributes never
appear; request correlation uses `request_id` (`X-Request-ID`) instead.

### Request-level sinks

Two bounded, non-blocking sinks (`telemetrySink`, `coordinator/api/telemetry_sink.go`;
`profileSink`, `coordinator/api/profiler_sink.go`) carry `inference_routes`
outcome writes and `request_profiles` rows off the request path. Each has a
4096-slot channel and a single worker; a full channel drops the write and
counts it (`telemetry.sink_dropped{sink:profile}`, or the route sink's atomic
surfaced as `fleet_snapshots.route_sink_dropped_total`). The `X-Timing` header
([`../reference/api-contracts.md#headers`](../reference/api-contracts.md#headers))
and the `inference.timing.*` histograms are built from the same
`RequestTimingDetails`. The profiler's own path is described in
[`system-profiler.md`](system-profiler.md); the outcome vocabularies behind
`inference.request_outcome` and `inference.error` in
[`request-outcome-observability.md`](request-outcome-observability.md).

## Invariants

1. **No prompt or completion text on any telemetry path.** The coordinator
   accepts no client telemetry, and each emitter call site passes only bounded
   enums, counters, byte counts and durations; media, prompt, token and
   cache-key content are excluded by construction. `sanitizeProviderInferenceError`
   (`coordinator/api/inference_error_sanitize.go`) never reads the provider's
   `error` string. The `profile` object is length-checked opaque bytes on the
   read loop and decoded only on the sink worker. Swift free-form log strings
   are `privacy: .private`.
2. **Three mirrors, one shape.** The event enums and JSON encoding are pinned by
   `coordinator/protocol/telemetry_symmetry_test.go` and
   `provider-swift/Tests/ProviderCoreTests/Telemetry/TelemetrySymmetryTests.swift`.
3. **Telemetry never changes control flow.** Nil emitter, nil Datadog client,
   full sink and unreachable intake are all silent no-ops or counted drops.
   Engine-health, `kv_backend` and `telemetry` heartbeat fields are
   measurement only; the scheduler does not gate on them.
4. **Tags come from the accepted snapshot and closed folds.** `SlotStateFold`,
   `ThermalStateFold`, `ProviderVersionFold` (`coordinator/registry/gate_reason.go`)
   and `KVBackendFallbackTag` (`coordinator/registry/kv_backend.go`) bound
   every provider-supplied string before it becomes a tag; `provider_id`
   appears only on the per-provider memory gauges.
5. **There is no client ingestion route.** `POST /v1/telemetry/events` is not
   registered; the mux answers 404 without reading the body
   (`TestTelemetryE2E_NoClientIngestionRoute`, `coordinator/api/telemetry_e2e_test.go`).

## Failure modes

| Condition | Effect | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Neither `DD_API_KEY` nor `DD_AGENT_HOST` set | no Datadog client; every metric and forwarded event is dropped; `slog` mirror and in-process counters still work | startup log lacks `datadog integration enabled` |
| `DD_API_KEY` set, no local agent | counters and gauges arrive via HTTPS; **histograms** (`inference.ttft_ms`, `http.latency_ms`, `inference.timing.*`) are lost | `datadog: DogStatsD client init failed` or silent UDP drops |
| Series or Logs intake returns ≥ 400 or times out (10 s) | batch dropped; one `Warn` per batch | `datadog: series API returned error`, `datadog: logs API request failed` |
| Profile or route sink full | write dropped and counted; request unaffected | `telemetry.sink_dropped{sink:profile}`, `route_sink_dropped_total` in `fleet_snapshots` |
| Stale or reordered `capacity_seq` | frame ignored except `LastHeartbeat`; metrics not re-emitted | registry debug log |
| Heartbeat prefix-cache telemetry fails validation | dropped for that frame | `routing.cache_telemetry_rejected{source:heartbeat}` |
| Provider older than the profiler slice | `slots[].telemetry` absent; wedge metrics silent for all-zero slots; `fleet_snapshots` telemetry columns zero | `provider_version` column |
| Abrupt disconnect at high memory pressure | classified OOM (`≥ 0.90`, or `≥ 0.80` with in-flight work) | `provider.oom_suspected`, `ws.disconnects`, `provider_sessions.disconnect_reason` |
| Event enum or encoding edited in one mirror only | CI fails | `TestTelemetryJSONSymmetry`, `TestTelemetryKindsMatch` (`coordinator/protocol/telemetry_symmetry_test.go`) |
| Expecting trace correlation | `dd.trace_id` never present (no spans) | use `request_id` |

Cache receipt diagnostics use `exact_cache.receipt` (Datadog) and
`exact_cache_receipt_total` (admin metrics), with bounded `type`, `outcome`,
and `reason` labels from `coordinator/registry/cache_receipt_result.go`. They
distinguish rejected evidence from provider-reported hits. APNs recovery emits
`code_attest.resume_proof_sent{basis:recent_apns|process_continuity}`,
`code_attest.proof_verified{kind:apns|resume}` and
`code_attest.coverage_persist{outcome:success|error}`. These are aggregate
operational metrics; they add no fields to the provider telemetry wire schema.

Per-model cache reporting is a separate internal `routing.cache_model.*`
family, mirrored by `cache_model_*` admin metrics. It distinguishes reported
usage, accepted proofs and cache-selected terminals without altering the public
aggregate cache response. Model IDs must be present in the active catalog;
other IDs use `unknown`. Timing sums and sample counts work over HTTPS as well
as DogStatsD. See the [metric inventory](../reference/telemetry-inventory.md#cache-results-by-model-internal)
for populations, labels and reset semantics (`coordinator/api/cache_model_telemetry.go`).
