# Provider quickstart

> Last updated: 2026-09-27 · commit `4ad3034df`

From a fresh Apple Silicon Mac to a provider that is registered with the
coordinator, linked to your account and serving. For operators; install, check,
log in, pick models, start, then confirm serving authorization. macOS 27 or later
uses App Attest without new Darkbloom MDM enrollment. Darkbloom MDM will be
deactivated soon; upgrade to macOS 27 to avoid the legacy enrollment step.

## Prerequisites

- A Mac that meets [hardware requirements](./hardware-requirements.md#minimum-requirements).
  `darkbloom start` refuses machines below the RAM floor or without a
  Metal GPU (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand+Preflight.swift`,
  `Start.runPreflightChecks`; `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand.swift`,
  `Start.prepareServeRuntime`).
- Outbound HTTPS (443) to `api.darkbloom.dev`; the provider is an outbound-only
  WebSocket client to `wss://api.darkbloom.dev/ws/provider`
  (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift`,
  `CoordinatorSettings.url`).
- A Darkbloom account for `darkbloom login`; the login flow prints the URL to
  open.

## Steps

### 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://api.darkbloom.dev/install.sh | bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

What the script verifies and writes is in [installation](./installation.md).

### 2. Check the machine

```bash
darkbloom doctor
```

Lines marked `✗` are failures. Hardware, Metal, SIP, account link, MDM
enrollment and coordinator reachability are all covered; the check names are
listed in [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks).

### 3. Download a model

`darkbloom start` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand.swift`) runs
preflight checks (SIP, debugger, GPU, memory), offers to link your account if
you are not logged in, shows an interactive model picker, asks whether models
should stay loaded while idle (`Always ready`) or be unloaded after 60 minutes
without requests and reloaded on demand (`Free when idle`, the default; or a
custom window), then installs and starts a `launchd` user agent.
Every idle-memory choice starts loading selected models before the daemon
registers with the coordinator, subject to the startup timeout, model-slot
limit and available memory ([startup preload details](./cli-reference.md#darkbloom-start)).

`darkbloom models download` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ModelsCommand.swift`)
resolves the catalog entry and fetches from `https://models.darkbloom.ai`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/ModelDownloader.swift`,
`defaultR2CDNURL`). `darkbloom start` also offers an interactive catalog picker
when nothing is downloaded yet, so this step can be skipped.

### 4. Link your account

```bash
darkbloom login
```

`Login` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/LoginCommand.swift`) runs the RFC 8628
device-code flow (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Auth/DeviceAuth.swift`,
`performDeviceCodeLogin`): `POST /v1/device/code`, print the verification URL
and one-time code, open the browser, poll `POST /v1/device/token` until you
approve. The token is saved to `~/.darkbloom/auth_token`. This link is what
makes the machine "yours" for [self-route](./self-route.md) and credits earnings
to your account. `darkbloom start` offers this step inline if you skip it.

### 5. Start serving

```bash
darkbloom start
```

`Start` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand.swift`,
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand+Daemon.swift`) prints the
Terms-of-Service notice (starting is acceptance), runs preflight, offers inline
login, shows the model picker unless `--model <id>` (repeatable) or `--all` is
given, then writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.darkbloom.provider.plist`
(`RunAtLoad = true`, `KeepAlive = false`;
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LaunchAgent.swift`) and starts it.
With `provider.auto_restart = true` (the default) it also arms the crash-recovery
watchdog `io.darkbloom.watchdog`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/WatchdogAgent.swift`). The service
starts again at every login.

### 6. Confirm verification

On **macOS 27 or later**, the installer and `darkbloom enroll` skip MDM profile
download and System Settings. Run `darkbloom status` and `darkbloom doctor` to
check App Attest approval. Serving requires a qualified signed provider and an
enabled coordinator; pending or unavailable approval does not trigger MDM
fallback. See [serving authorization](../reference/provider-authorization.md).

On **older macOS**, upgrade to macOS 27 to avoid MDM, or finish the legacy setup:

```bash
darkbloom enroll
```

Approve the Darkbloom profile in System Settings and follow the
[legacy verification steps](./attestation.md#steps). Darkbloom MDM will be
deactivated soon. Keep any employer management profile. Existing Darkbloom
profiles should remain installed until `darkbloom unenroll` approves App Attest
migration; choosing full exit instead stops the provider.

## Verify

```bash
darkbloom status            # config, hardware, live daemon state, trust level
darkbloom doctor            # ✓ daemon connected, ✓ trust level, ✓ account link
darkbloom logs --last 1h    # unified logs, subsystem dev.darkbloom.provider
```

`status` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StatusCommand.swift`) and `doctor`
read the daemon's snapshot `~/.darkbloom/daemon-state.json`; its refresh period
and the stale threshold are in
[troubleshooting → Doctor checks](./troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks). A stale
snapshot is reported as such
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/DaemonStateFile.swift`, `isStale`).

The provider becomes eligible for public traffic after the coordinator grants
current App Attest authorization or complete legacy verification. Check recorded
earnings in the dashboard; connection or setup completion alone does not prove
that the provider is serving or earning. See [attestation](./attestation.md).

## Configuration

The config file is optional: `~/.config/darkbloom/provider.toml`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift`,
`defaultConfigPath`). Without it every key takes the code default; `darkbloom
autoupdate` and `darkbloom beta` write it when they change a value. The keys
that matter on day one, with an omitted key taking its code default:

```toml
[provider]
# memory_reserve_gb, auto_update, auto_restart, update_jitter_seconds

[backend]
enabled_models = []          # empty = every local model the box can serve
# idle_timeout_mins (0 disables unloading), max_model_slots, engine_v2_max_concurrent

[coordinator]
private_only = false         # true = serve only your own self-route traffic
# url, heartbeat_interval_secs
```

- `gemma_optimizations.prefill_layer18` — default ON, including when an older
  config omits the section or key. Set to `false` and restart to restore legacy
  one-final-submission Gemma prefill. The default and missing-key decode are in
  `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationSettings.swift:16-34`;
  the missing-section fallback is in
  `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift:397-400`.
- `gemma_optimizations.weighted_r1` — default ON, including when omitted. This
  is one atomic production control for weighted unsort and safe R1; the two
  paths cannot be configured independently
  (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationSettings.swift:10-18`,
  coupled projection at
  `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.swift:14-22`).
- Provider TOML is authoritative for both controls. Changes take effect at
  process restart; after setting either key to `false`, run `darkbloom restart`
  to activate the rollback. The start path projects config before Metal access
  (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand.swift:84-91` and
  `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServeRuntimePreparer.swift:24-35`), while
  `darkbloom beta` durably locks, reloads, and saves the selected value before
  printing the restart boundary
  (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/BetaCommand.swift:201-235`).
- `backend.enabled_models` — if non-empty, only these models are advertised.
- `backend.idle_timeout_mins` — the idle-memory policy: minutes without
  requests before a model is unloaded and its memory returned to the Mac
  (default 60; reloaded on demand with a ~10-30 s cold start), or `0` to keep
  models loaded for instant responses. `darkbloom start` asks for this
  interactively; change it later with `darkbloom idle keep-loaded` /
  `darkbloom idle unload-after <minutes>`.
- `backend.max_model_slots` — maximum resident models at once (default 3).
- `config_version` — schema version of this file, written automatically on
  first start after upgrading. It only dates the file, so the provider can
  tell a value the previous release GENERATED from one you chose. Leave it
  alone; deleting it re-runs the one-time upgrade migrations below.
- `backend.engine_v2_max_concurrent` — box-wide concurrent-request cap per
  engine slot (default **4** as of v0.8.1, clamped to `[1, 8]`). v0.8.0 raised
  it to 8 because PagedAttention made the batch curve keep climbing (paged
  gains 1.27x from B=4 to B=8, contiguous only 1.069x); v0.8.1 reverts the
  paged default, so the raise goes back with it. 4 is the knee of the measured
  contiguous curve — aggregate throughput is flat from B=4 to B=8 and collapses
  below it, while per-request decode is aggregate/B and so improves as the
  batch shrinks, which is what a time-to-first-token deadline is scored on.
  A `provider.toml` written by v0.8.0 carries an explicit `= 8` that release
  generated; because that is **indistinguishable from a deliberate 8**, first
  start after upgrading changes it to 4 once, logs a warning saying so, and
  bumps `config_version` to 2. If you want 8, set it again afterwards — from
  then on it is honoured. The `[1, 8]` upper bound is unchanged, so 8 stays
  available both box-wide and per-model, which is what a box running
  `engine_v2_kv_backend = "paged"` wants.
- `backend.engine_v2_kv_backend` — KV-cache backend for the inference engine:
  `"auto"` remains the default. The candidate selects paged only for the
  [exact Qwen allowlist](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts); every
  other ID, including unlisted Qwen, GPT-OSS and Gemma, stays contiguous.
  **The candidate rollout is not yet validated**; see the retained failures
  and remaining gates in the
  [Qwen-first rollout decision](../design/qwen-first-paged-ssd-rollout.md).
  Use `"contiguous"` to pin that backend, or `"paged"` to require paged
  construction. Per-model `engine_v2_kv_backend_by_model` entries override
  the global setting (`EngineV2KVBackendPolicy.parseSelection`,
  `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/EngineV2KVBackendPolicy.swift`).
  Under `"auto"`, paged preflight/construction failures fall back to
  contiguous; the version-bound crash-loop guard also forces automatic
  selections contiguous. Explicit `"paged"` construction failures instead
  **refuse the load (503)**. Capability/span-mask vetoes and
  `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV=0` can still force contiguous even for explicit
  paged; the kill switch is forwarded to launchd and never turns paging on.
  Check `darkbloom status` and `darkbloom doctor` for the actual backend and
  fallback reason rather than assuming `"auto"` proves paged service.
  SSD prefix reuse stays enabled by default for eligible checkpoints,
  including complete Qwen checkpoints on contiguous; resident retention
  remains off unless explicitly enabled with `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY=1`.
  Paging rollback does not itself disable SSD reuse; `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE=0`
  disables local reuse independently
  ([prefix-cache policy](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts)).
  A paged model starts with empty segmented storage under
  its admitted KV grant. Pages are reserved and allocated as requests need
  them; changing the grant does not preallocate or free live backing. See
  [KV slot grants](../architecture/hardware-support.md#kv-slot-grants) for
  co-resident shrink/regrow and the unchanged memory admission gates.
- `coordinator.private_only` — serve only your own self-route traffic; never
  join the public fleet.

## Earnings and billing

During the public alpha the platform fee is 0%, so providers keep 100% of the
per-token revenue (`coordinator/payments/pricing.go:39-43`).

There is no `darkbloom earnings` CLI command. View payouts, Stripe Connect
status, and usage in the console at `https://console.darkbloom.dev`.

Self-route traffic to your own machine is always free; see
[self-route](./self-route.md).
