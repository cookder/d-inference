# Provider troubleshooting

> Last updated: 2026-09-27 · commit `a2ec0da03`

Symptom → check → fix for the `darkbloom` provider: installer exits, `doctor`
check names, service lifecycle, coordinator connection, updates, models and the
KV-backend guard. For operators; every fix is a command you run on the Mac.

## Prerequisites

Start every session with the three read-only commands:

```bash
darkbloom doctor --strict      # ✓ / ⚠ / ✗ per check; exit 1 on any ⚠ or ✗
darkbloom status               # config, hardware, live daemon snapshot
darkbloom logs --last 1h       # unified logs, subsystem dev.darkbloom.provider
```

`doctor` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/DoctorCommand.swift`, `Doctor`) and
`status` read `~/.darkbloom/daemon-state.json`, which the daemon rewrites every
`max(1, heartbeat_interval_secs / 2)` s. A snapshot older than the stale
threshold is `STALE`; older than `max(8 × refresh period, stale threshold)` s
and `doctor` reports the daemon as wedged
(`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/KVBackendPosture.swift`,
`wedgedAfterSeconds`). The heartbeat default and the stale threshold are in
[`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants).

## Installer exits

All messages come from `scripts/install.sh`; each exits 1 and, once the download
has started, leaves the previous install untouched.

| Message | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Error: Darkbloom requires macOS with Apple Silicon.` / `… requires Apple Silicon (arm64).` | `uname` ≠ `Darwin` or `uname -m` ≠ `arm64` (Rosetta shell included) | Run in a native `arm64` shell on an Apple Silicon Mac |
| `Could not reach coordinator at …` | `GET $COORD_URL/v1/releases/latest` failed | Check network/DNS; `curl -fsSL https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/releases/latest`. From a checkout, set `COORD_URL` (the source keeps the `__DARKBLOOM_COORD_URL__` placeholder) |
| `Coordinator response missing required fields (url / bundle_hash / version).` | Release record incomplete | Coordinator-side release publishing problem; retry later |
| `Bundle hash mismatch — refusing to install possibly-tampered binary.` | Tarball SHA-256 ≠ `bundle_hash` | Re-run; a proxy or partial download is the usual cause |
| `Release bundle is missing required flat verifier files.` | No `bin/darkbloom`, `bin/darkbloom-enclave` or `bin/mlx.metallib` in the tarball | Bad release artifact; report it |
| `Binary hash mismatch …` / `Metallib hash mismatch …` / `App binary hash mismatch …` / `App releases require binary_hash and metallib_hash.` | Staged file ≠ published hash, or an app release without both hashes | Re-run; if it persists the release record and artifact disagree |
| `Staged Darkbloom.app does not satisfy the pinned signature requirement.` / `Legacy flat artifact does not satisfy …` | `codesign --verify --deep --strict -R=…` failed against `identifier "io.darkbloom.provider"`, Team `SLDQ2GJ6TL` | Do not install; the artifact is not the signed release |
| `Fan-helper CLI capability, marker, and nested helper must be present together.` / `… marker is invalid.` / `Bundled fan helper must be a regular executable …` / `… must have mode 0755.` / `… does not satisfy the pinned helper signature requirement.` | Fan-helper capability triple inconsistent in the staged app | Bad artifact; report it |
| `Paged-capable staged app is missing its signed capability marker.` / `Staged app advertises paged capability without paged runtime code.` / `Paged runtime capability marker is invalid.` / `… requires exactly one sealed MLXLMCommon pagedattention.metal.` | Paged-kernel marker ⇔ binary ⇔ resource mismatch | Bad artifact; report it |
| `Packaged App Attest callback runtime smoke failed.` or missing callback marker | The staged callback runtime failed before Metal validation | Keep the existing installed app; retry with a fixed release and report the provider/macOS versions |
| `Packaged runtime smoke failed (App Attest, configuration, or Metal).` | One of the staged runtime checks failed | Run the staged app’s `runtime-smoke` to identify the last success marker; report its output and macOS version |
| `Atomic app swap failed; previous install was restored.` | `mv` into `~/.darkbloom` failed | Check free space and permissions on `~/.darkbloom` |
| `Secure Enclave ⚠ (not available on this hardware …)` (warning, install continues) | `darkbloom-enclave info` failed | Trust stays below `hardware`; see [attestation](./attestation.md) |
| `Enrollment ⚠ …` (warning) | Profile not installed, or `POST /v1/enroll` unreachable | `darkbloom enroll`, then install the profile in System Settings |
| `darkbloom: command not found` after install | Shell not reloaded; rc file is `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bashrc` only if `~/.zshrc` is absent | `source ~/.zshrc`, or `export PATH="$HOME/.darkbloom/bin:$PATH"` |

## Doctor checks

`darkbloom doctor` prints an operator diagnosis (sections attestation key,
App Attest, attestation readiness, trust, model fit, runtime, billing, version;
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/DoctorRunner.swift`,
`buildOperatorDiagnosis`) followed by `DETAILED CHECKS`
(`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/DoctorCommand.swift`, `buildDoctorChecks`,
`buildCoordinatorDoctorChecks`). Check names are stable identifiers:

| Check | What it tests | When it is not ✓ |
|---|---|---|
| `hardware`, `metal gpu`, `macos` | Chip/RAM detection, Metal device, OS version | Apple Silicon with a working GPU is required; nothing to configure |
| `config` | `provider.toml` parses | Fix the TOML at `~/.config/darkbloom/provider.toml`; retired keys only warn |
| `huggingface cache`, `local mlx models` | `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` exists and holds serveable models | `darkbloom models download <id>` |
| `sip`, `authenticated root`, `hardened runtime`, `debugger`, `binary hash`, `rdma` | Boot security and process integrity the coordinator scores | `csrutil enable` from Recovery; detach debuggers; reinstall if the binary hash is unknown. Effects on trust: [attestation](./attestation.md) |
| `account link` | `~/.darkbloom/auth_token` present and accepted | `darkbloom login` |
| `mdm enrollment`, `mdm verification` | Profile installed; coordinator has cross-checked `SecurityInfo` | `darkbloom enroll`; the steps and what to expect: [Reaching and keeping `hardware` trust](./attestation.md#steps) |
| `console session`, `automatic login`, `auto-logout on idle`, `sleep prevention` | Attestation readiness (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Diagnostics/AttestationReadiness.swift`) | A real console user must be logged in; enable automatic login; disable auto-logout; the daemon self-caffeinates while serving |
| `active se key` | Secure Enclave signing key self-test | `darkbloom-enclave info`; hardware without SE runs at reduced trust |
| `launch session`, `app attest support`, `apple operation`, `app attest key` | macOS 27+ only: the daemon's last local App Attest observation (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Diagnostics/AppAttestLocalDiagnosis.swift`) — GUI session, `is_supported_false`, a stalled DeviceCheck call, stored/enrolled key and generation cooldown | Run the provider inside the logged-in GUI session (`darkbloom restart` after logging in) and keep SIP and Full Security; a stall clears when the provider restarts ([attestation](./attestation.md#app-attest-without-darkbloom-mdm)); never delete the Keychain item |
| `gui session` | macOS 27+: the provider runs outside the GUI session. Either a user is logged in at the console but the provider was launched elsewhere (SSH, system daemon), or nobody is logged in (`AppAttestDeepDiagnosis.swift`) | Run `darkbloom restart` from the logged-in desktop (Terminal or Screen Sharing). If nobody is logged in, log in and enable automatic login |
| `boot security` | SIP or authenticated root is not confirmed enabled. Apple requires Full Security for App Attest | In Recovery: `csrutil enable`, `csrutil authenticated-root enable`, Startup Security Utility → Full Security, restart |
| `app signing` | A known missing opt-in, invalid environment entitlement, or missing/expired profile fails. Unavailable signing data or unknown expiry warns instead of passing; an explicitly absent environment entitlement can be legitimate | Reinstall a known-bad release (`curl -fsSL https://api.darkbloom.dev/install.sh \| bash`), then restart; for indeterminate evidence, collect a report |
| `process start` | Why this provider process started (launchd, watchdog, update, stall restart, manual) and whether the previous one shut down cleanly (`provider-run.json`) | Unclean exits come from a crash, force-kill, power loss or a reboot without a drain. If App Attest broke right after one, run `darkbloom report` |
| `key history`, `last apple failure` | Key generations in 24 h, key age and boot, last Apple success, consecutive assertion failures, and the last native error chain. CryptoTokenKit `-3` with an `aks` code means the Secure Enclave refused to sign. Doctor distinguishes a latest error eligible for coordinator dead-key checks from timeouts or `serverUnavailable`; the aggregate failure count alone cannot establish a dead key or promise rotation | The coordinator decides whether replacement is due. For repeated `invalidKey` on brand-new keys, run `darkbloom report` from an administrator account (or `sudo darkbloom report` if this account can use sudo) |
| `apns pushes` | APNs code-identity pushes received and answered in 24 h, and whether APNs registration produced a device token (`apns-push-history.json`) | No token: APNs registration failed, so stay in the GUI session and restart. None received while the coordinator says it pushed: an APNs delivery problem, so keep the Mac awake and online. Received but unanswered: `darkbloom restart` |
| `devicecheckd log` | Device-wide system App Attest patterns, potentially from other apps; they cannot be attributed to Darkbloom or establish this provider's key failure. Administrator log access is required | Use an explicit administrator-run report for supporting context; do not infer provider key loss or rotate a key from these observations alone |
| `coordinator health`, `minimum version`, `coordinator trust` | Coordinator reachable, this version is accepted, trust verdict with reasons | `darkbloom update`; reasons are explained in [attestation](./attestation.md) |
| `trust level` stuck at `self_signed` | The MDM `SecurityInfo` cross-check has not passed for this connection | `darkbloom enroll` if not enrolled; otherwise wait — see [Reaching and keeping `hardware` trust](./attestation.md#troubleshooting) |
| `daemon`, `daemon connected`, `daemon state freshness` | Daemon process alive, WebSocket connected, snapshot refreshed | See [service lifecycle](#the-service-does-not-stay-running); a stale snapshot ⇒ `darkbloom restart` |
| `recent model load` | Last model-load error recorded by the daemon | See [models and memory](#models-and-memory) |
| `kv backend posture`, `kv backend crash-loop guard` | Explicit `engine_v2_kv_backend` request honoured; guard record present | See [KV-backend guard](#kv-backend-crash-loop-guard) |
| `competing inference` | Another inference server holds the GPU (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/CompetingInferenceDiagnostics.swift`) | Quit it; it competes for the same unified memory and GPU time |
| `usage reporting` | Usage rows the coordinator has not acknowledged (`usageGaps > 0`) | Transient after reconnects; persistent gaps ⇒ `darkbloom report` |
| `up to date` | `SelfUpdater.checkForUpdate`; also reports a quarantined release | See [updates](#updates) |

`darkbloom verify` runs the same set and exits 1 on any ⚠.

The process-table, local-port and sleep probes have a five-second execution
deadline, followed by bounded child termination. Large output is captured in
a temporary file, which is removed after the probe. A failed contention probe
adds no hints; a failed sleep probe reports unavailable. These bounds apply
to `LocalContentionSnapshot.runCapture` and `DoctorRunner.systemSleepPrevented`
in `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/CompetingInferenceDiagnostics.swift`
and `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/DoctorRunner.swift`, using
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Process/BoundedProcess.swift`
(`runCapturingStandardOutput`).

## `darkbloom start` fails

| Message | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `--local and --local-endpoint are mutually exclusive …` | Both flags given | Pick one ([direct mode](./direct-mode.md)) |
| `A debugger is attached. The coordinator will reject this provider.` | `checkDebuggerAttached()` | Detach the debugger |
| `This Mac has N GB RAM. At least 8 GB is needed to serve any model.` | `Start.runPreflightChecks` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand+Preflight.swift`) | Use a larger machine ([hardware requirements](./hardware-requirements.md)) |
| `Cannot start: …` | `Start.prepareServeRuntime` — `GPUEnforcement.requireMetal` failed, or the Gemma runtime environment could not be applied (`GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.apply`) | Confirm a Metal GPU (`system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType`); retry |
| `Cannot start: hardware detection failed …` | `sysctl`/`system_profiler` failed | Retry; report the output of `sysctl machdep.cpu.brand_string hw.memsize` |
| `No models selected.` | Picker cancelled or `--model` ids not local | `darkbloom models list`; `darkbloom models download <id>` |
| `No engine-v2-capable models available to serve.` (`--local`) | Every local model's family lacks a CBv2 adapter | Download a supported family (gpt-oss, gemma-4) |
| `Local server failed to bind <addr>:<port> within 5s` | Port in use | `--port <other>`, or stop the other process |
| `Cannot start --local-endpoint: failed to create the local API token …` | `~/.darkbloom` not writable | Fix permissions, or `--no-auth` on a trusted network |
| `warning: … RETIRED knob and is IGNORED` | A retired `[backend]` key or env var is set | Remove it; see [beta features](./beta-features.md#retired) |

## The service does not stay running

```bash
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/io.darkbloom.provider | head   # loaded? last exit status?
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/io.darkbloom.watchdog | head
tail -50 ~/.darkbloom/provider.log ~/.darkbloom/watchdog.log
```

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Service gone after `darkbloom stop` and a reboot | `stop` disables the label; auto-start returns only with `darkbloom start` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StopCommand.swift`) | `darkbloom start` |
| Daemon exits and nobody restarts it | The provider plist has `KeepAlive = false`; restarts are the watchdog's job, armed only when `provider.auto_restart = true` | Set `auto_restart = true`; `darkbloom restart` re-arms it (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/RestartCommand.swift`) |
| Models unload after a while, daemon stays up | `backend.idle_timeout_mins` elapsed (default in the [`provider.toml` table](./cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli)); reload is lazy on the next request (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+IdleTimeout.swift`) | Expected. `idle_timeout_mins = 0` disables unloading |
| Provider offline after logout / at the login window | GUI LaunchAgents run only inside a logged-in session | Enable automatic login; see `console session` above |
| Daemon restarts every few minutes, then `kv backend crash-loop guard` appears | `crashLoopTripThreshold` restarts inside the watchdog window (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/WatchdogDecision.swift`; value in [runtime constants](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants)) | See [KV-backend guard](#kv-backend-crash-loop-guard) |
| `darkbloom restart` prints `Provider is not running. Start it with darkbloom start.` | Plist not installed | `darkbloom start` |

## Coordinator connection

| Symptom | Mechanism | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `daemon connected` ⚠, console shows offline | The client reconnects with an exponential backoff (`ExponentialBackoff`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Coordinator/CoordinatorClient+Connection.swift`; bounds in [runtime constants](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants)) | `curl -v https://api.darkbloom.dev/health`; check DNS, clock, TLS interception, firewall on 443 |
| Log: `WebSocket pong timeout (no response in 30s)` | No pong within `pongTimeout` of a `pingInterval` ping closes the socket and the backoff restarts it ([runtime constants](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants)) | Network path stalls; nothing to configure on the provider |
| Heartbeats arrive but requests do not | A heartbeat every `heartbeat_interval_secs` proves the connection, not routability | `darkbloom doctor` → `trust level`, `coordinator trust`; the routing gates are listed in [`../architecture/security/attestation.md#routing-gate`](../architecture/security/attestation.md#routing-gate) |
| `minimum version` ✗ | Coordinator rejects this `ProviderCore.version` | `darkbloom update` |

## Updates

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Latest release vX is quarantined on this machine.` | vX crashed `rollbackThreshold` times before surviving `defaultStabilizationSeconds` (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Update/UpdateRecoveryState.swift`; values in [runtime constants](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants)) | Wait for the next release (it installs normally), or `darkbloom update --override-quarantine` |
| `vX is already installed on disk but this process is vY.` | Update landed, daemon not restarted | `darkbloom restart` |
| `SHA-256 hash mismatch!` | Download ≠ `bundle_hash`/`binary_hash`/`metallib_hash` | Retry; persistent mismatch means the release record and artifact disagree |
| `another update/recovery operation is active` | Watchdog recovery or a previous update holds the lock | Wait a minute; retry |
| No automatic updates | `provider.auto_update = false`, or `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` set in a `--foreground` shell | `darkbloom autoupdate status`, `darkbloom autoupdate enable` |
| Fan control stops after an update | The unprivileged updater does not replace the root helper | `sudo darkbloom fan enable` ([fan control](./fan-control.md)) |

The check cadence (`autoUpdateInitialDelay`, `autoUpdateInterval`), the
`update_jitter_seconds` install delay and the `updateDrainTimeout` before the
restart (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+AutoUpdate.swift`)
are tabulated in [`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants).

## Models and memory

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `model fit` ✗ / `recent model load` shows admission refused | `ModelLoadAdmission` (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/ModelLoadAdmission.swift`) found less free-for-load memory than the model's padded weights plus headroom ([load gate](../architecture/hardware-support.md#load-gate-modelloadadmission)) | Close other apps; lower `max_model_slots`; pick a smaller quantisation ([hardware requirements](./hardware-requirements.md)) |
| Model missing from `darkbloom models list` | Not in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`, or filtered by `enabled_models` | `darkbloom models download <id>`; `darkbloom models list --all` |
| Load fails after a catalog update | New build published for the alias | `darkbloom models remove <id>` then `darkbloom models download <id>` |
| `Skipping <id>: model_type … has no engine-v2 adapter` | Family not served by CBv2 | Use a supported family; the model is never advertised |
| Slow decode, GPU busy | `competing inference` ⚠ | Quit the other server |

## KV-backend crash-loop guard

The watchdog writes `~/.darkbloom/kv-backend-guard.json` after
`crashLoopTripThreshold` restarts ([runtime constants](./cli-reference.md#runtime-constants));
while it matches the running version the
engine forces `auto` selections to contiguous KV, without overriding explicit
backend settings, and `doctor` shows `kv backend crash-loop guard`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/KVBackendGuard.swift`;
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/KVBackendGuardDiagnostics.swift`).

```bash
darkbloom doctor                        # read the guard record and the posture per slot
darkbloom doctor --clear-backend-guard  # delete the record, reset the crash-loop counter
darkbloom restart
```

A new binary version clears a stale record on start. Clearing the guard restores
normal selection on the next model load: candidate `auto` retries paged only for
the [exact Qwen allowlist](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts); all other
IDs remain contiguous. Automatic paged failures still fall back to contiguous.
Explicit settings, capability/span-mask vetoes and `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_PAGED_KV=0`
still apply, so clearing the guard does not guarantee paged service. The
[Qwen-first rollout](../design/qwen-first-paged-ssd-rollout.md) is **not yet
validated**; clearing a guard is not validation of that rollout.

`kv backend posture` ✗ means an explicit backend request was refused or the
served backend differs from the request. An explicit
`engine_v2_kv_backend = "paged"` (or per-model entry) refuses construction
failures instead of falling back; a kill switch or capability veto can instead
produce a contiguous slot. Read the reported reason. Set `"contiguous"` to pin
that backend, or `"auto"` to allow model-aware selection and fallback; `"auto"`
is not a contiguous pin for the cohort. Explicit `"paged"` bypasses the
automatic crash-loop guard, not the kill switch or capability vetoes
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/EngineV2KVBackendPolicy.swift`,
`degradesPagedFailure`; `EngineV2Factory+BackendPreparation.swift`,
`prepareProductionBackend`).

Paging rollback alone does not disable eligible Qwen SSD reuse on contiguous.
SSD caching remains enabled by default with no resident retention; use
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE=0` to disable local reuse independently
([prefix-cache defaults](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#invariants)).

## Collect a report

```bash
darkbloom doctor --support > doctor.txt
darkbloom status > status.txt
darkbloom report --last 24h --dry-run   # review exactly what would be sent
darkbloom report --last 24h             # upload; prints report_id
```

`Report` (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ReportCommand.swift`) collects
subsystem `dev.darkbloom.provider` at info level with macOS privacy redaction
intact, uploads only when you run it, and prints the `report_id` to quote to
support. It appends the provider's closed App Attest snapshot, APNs push history
and device-wide `devicecheckd` pattern matches; see
[`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#darkbloom-report) for scope and fields.
macOS lets only administrator accounts read the system log. Run the report from
an administrator account, or run `sudo darkbloom report` if this account is
allowed to use sudo. Otherwise only the App Attest snapshot is sent, without
provider logs or `devicecheckd` evidence.
