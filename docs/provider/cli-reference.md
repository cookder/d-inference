# Provider CLI reference

> Last updated: 2026-09-27 · commit `81e7f1532`

Reference for the `darkbloom` command-line tool: every subcommand and flag, the
files and identifiers it creates, the `provider.toml` keys it reads with their
defaults, the environment variables it forwards to the daemon, and its runtime
constants, as declared in `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/` (`Darkbloom`,
version `ProviderCore.version` = `0.9.7` in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderCore.swift`). For operators; types
and defaults are the ArgumentParser declarations; `—` means required.

## Global options

Every `darkbloom` invocation on macOS below 27 prints an informational upgrade
warning to stderr before command parsing or AppKit hosting, including help,
version and background commands. `MacOSUpgradeNotice.emit` in
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/MacOSUpgradeNotice.swift` names the local OS,
upcoming Darkbloom MDM deactivation, continued legacy verification during the
transition and the need to retain the profile until App Attest migration is
approved. The warning performs no network/config/profile operations and does
not change command execution, exit codes or stdout/JSON. macOS 27+ prints no
upgrade warning. It is independent of `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`.

| Option | Type | Default | Effect | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `-c`, `--config <path>` | `String?` | `~/.config/darkbloom/provider.toml` | Provider TOML path. Accepted by the commands marked ✓ below | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Darkbloom.swift` (`ConfigOptions`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift` (`defaultConfigPath`) |
| `--version` | flag | — | Prints `ProviderCore.version` | `Darkbloom.configuration` |
| `-h`, `--help` | flag | — | Help; `darkbloom` with no subcommand prints help | `Darkbloom.run` |

Before most subcommands run, `runUpdateBannerIfEnabled`
(`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Darkbloom.swift`) checks for a newer release
with a 2 s hard timeout and prints a one-line banner; `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`
set to any value skips it. Logging goes to stderr so launchd captures it in
`~/.darkbloom/provider.log`.

### `darkbloom start`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--coordinator-url <url>` | `String?` | `coordinator.url` (`wss://api.darkbloom.dev/ws/provider`) | Override the coordinator WebSocket URL |
| `--model <id>` | `[String]`, repeatable | `[]` | Serve exactly these models; skips the picker |
| `--all` | flag | `false` | Serve every local model the runtime supports; skips the picker |
| `--idle-timeout <mins>` | `UInt64?` | `backend.idle_timeout_mins` (`60`) | Override the idle unload timeout for this run |
| `--foreground` / `--no-foreground` | flag, **hidden** | `false` | Serve in this process instead of installing the LaunchAgent; launchd passes it |
| `--local` | flag | `false` | Coordinator-less OpenAI-compatible server ([direct mode](./direct-mode.md)) |
| `--local-endpoint` | flag | `false` | Local endpoint alongside the coordinator; mutually exclusive with `--local` |
| `--port <n>` | `UInt16` | `8000` | Local server port |
| `--bind <addr>` | `String` | `127.0.0.1` | Local server bind address |
| `--no-auth` | flag | `false` | Disable the local bearer-token check |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | integer, 0–3600 | `600` | Drain a running provider before replacing its process/configuration |
| `--force` | flag | `false` | Explicitly permit cancellation if the old provider cannot drain |

Exit 1 (`ExitCode.failure`) when `--local` and `--local-endpoint` are combined,
a debugger is attached, RAM is below 8 GB, Metal is unavailable, hardware
detection fails, no model is selected, or the local server does not bind within
5 s (`StartCommand+Preflight.swift`, `StartCommand+Modes.swift`).

A replacement start completes the picker/preflight and saves the selected IDs
under `backend.enabled_models` while holding the lifecycle lease, before it
disables recovery or drains/stops the current provider. Failure of this initial
selection write leaves the current service unchanged. After drain acknowledgement,
Autopilot consent is saved before stopping the daemon and installing the chosen
configuration. If this later write fails, a gracefully drained daemon is left
running and drained, with recovery disabled; correct the configuration and retry
`start`. No replacement is installed (`Start.completeDaemonReplacement`). Foreground/local starts also require a drained handoff;
the process-lifetime kernel lock never silently sends SIGKILL after a short grace period.
On launchd-managed foreground starts (including restart and watchdog recovery),
an explicitly pinned `enabled_models` takes precedence over old `--model` plist
arguments. A directly invoked foreground `--model` still overrides config
(`Start.usesPinnedModelSelection`, `Start.launchDaemon`).

The config sidecar lock spans persistence and synchronous drain setup. If
disabling recovery or publishing the request fails, the exact previous TOML
bytes (or original file absence) are restored, including whether the model key
was pinned. Restoration failures are reported. Once publication succeeds, a
later drain timeout retains the replacement intent; no config lock is held while
waiting (`ProviderModelSelection.withReplacement`,
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProviderModelSelection.swift`).
Missing custom files are seeded from this invocation's resolved configuration,
not from the separate canonical config file.

### `darkbloom switch`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--model <id>` | `[String]`, repeatable | `[]` | Replace the complete hosted selection with these local IDs; any invalid ID rejects the whole selection |
| `--all` | flag | `false` | Select all eligible local models; mutually exclusive with `--model` |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | integer, 0–3600 | `600` | Graceful drain deadline; `0` refuses unfinished work immediately but still acknowledges an already-settled drain |

With neither selection flag, this command reuses the `start` catalog picker and
downloader. It checks fresh daemon identity and switch capability before opening
the picker, and uses the running daemon's runtime capabilities rather than
initializing a second inference runtime. There is no `--force` or `--config`:
the daemon's own resolved config path, including a custom path, is authoritative.

The provider validates local artifacts before fencing new coordinator and
unified-local admissions, finishes accepted requests and terminal usage, and
asks the coordinator to validate the complete selection before unloading anything.
It then replaces its full model inventory on the existing coordinator session.
It does not restart the process, reconnect, re-attest, install a service, or
change watchdog/login recovery settings. Coordinator URL, authentication and
local endpoint settings remain unchanged. Selected resident models can stay
loaded; new models load on demand under the existing memory safeguards.
The coordinator must support `models_replace`; deploy the coordinator upgrade
before enabling this command on providers. Unsupported or missing receipts fail
closed rather than forcing a reconnect.

With `--timeout 0`, an already-idle provider still waits up to 30 seconds for the
coordinator's terminal barrier; zero never skips usage settlement. Nonzero
deadlines retain their full drain-and-barrier budget. Artifact validation occurs
before this deadline and can be preempted by stop/restart or OS shutdown; a late
hash result cannot change provider state. Each switch request is atomically
consumed, so a later scheduled window in the same process cannot replay it.
Sources: `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+ModelSwitch.swift`
(`drainForModelSwitch`, `cancelModelSwitchAndWait`),
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LifecycleMailbox.swift` (`claimSwitchRequest`).

Validation carries each snapshot's pre-hash fingerprint into the live model
state. Where load policy permits hash reuse, unchanged snapshots avoid a second
full weight read; metadata changes and mandatory fresh/SSD checks still rehash.
Rollback restores the previous hash/fingerprint pair
(`ProviderModelSwitchValidation`,
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProviderModelSwitchValidation.swift`).

Eligible local off-catalog models can remain in the selection for owner-only
inference, just as at registration. They do not become publicly routable; tracked
models still need their pinned catalog hashes and required runtime capabilities
(`coordinator/registry/provider_models_replace.go`, `ReplaceProviderModels`).

Success requires a matching completion receipt from the running provider, not
just mailbox publication. The provider requires a matching
`models_replace_resumed` receipt from the coordinator before writing that
completion receipt. A successful selection is persisted for later restart,
watchdog recovery and scheduled serving windows. Stale/missing/older daemons and
standalone `--local` servers fail without launching anything. A drain timeout returns failure and
leaves admission closed while accepted work continues; retry `switch` after
the outstanding work finishes. Rejected selections are not partially applied.
Live rollback restores an originally absent model key/file when no other edit
intervened. Concurrent unrelated config changes are retained; a newer model
selection is never silently overwritten. An unavailable completion receipt is
reported as unconfirmed, never success, and coordinator routing stays fenced
when the committing `models_replace_ack` cannot be written. If the final
`models_replace_resumed` receipt is lost, routing may already have resumed;
`switch` reports the outcome as unconfirmed.
`status` displays the latest switch outcome, request ID, unfinished-request count,
message and selection; stale daemon snapshots are explicitly marked
(`Status.printDaemonStatus` in `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StatusCommand.swift`).
Sources: `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/SwitchCommand.swift` (`Switch`),
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProviderModelSelection.swift`
(`ProviderModelSelection.stageReplacement`, `ProviderModelSelection.restore`).
After provider readiness, the coordinator refreshes desired alias builds
for the current inventory; the provider preserves snapshots received during the
commit wait. It restores prefetching before sending readiness, so the refreshed
snapshot can converge even if it arrives before the routing receipt.
The provider publishes refreshed capacity immediately after reopening local
admission; the ready frame names that heartbeat's `capacity_seq`. The coordinator
waits for the matching sequence and ready frame before routing queued work.

Scheduled serving keeps the initial foreground selection, including manual
`--model` overrides, until a live switch or a change to `backend.enabled_models`
on disk. Each later window reads that selection from the same resolved config path.
An empty saved list selects all eligible local models found for that window;
explicit IDs select only those models. The provider validates and hashes the
result before reopening; an invalid selection fails instead of reverting to
startup models. The scheduled loop keeps the original window end while hashing
and skips startup if that window has closed. A late start serves only for the
remaining window time. Other provider settings, runtime
identity/capabilities and local endpoint options remain frozen for the process
(`ScheduledWindowSelection` in `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ScheduledWindowSelection.swift`;
`Start.runScheduled` in `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand+Modes.swift`).


### Graceful stop and restart

```bash
darkbloom stop --timeout 600
darkbloom restart --timeout 600 --startup-timeout 180
darkbloom stop --force             # explicit interruption, including stalled work
```

Use the [stop flags](#darkbloom-stop) and [restart flags](#darkbloom-restart) below
for deadline recovery. Commands do not initiate graceful shutdown by killing the
serve task. `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT` and AppKit termination enter the same drain;
standalone local mode also waits for active HTTP response bodies. The signal
deadline is configurable with
[`DARKBLOOM_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`](../reference/configuration.md#provider-drain-deadline).
Signal-only shutdown disarms current watchdog recovery but preserves configured
login startup; use `darkbloom stop` for a persistent stop.
Newly installed or CLI-restarted jobs have launchd `ExitTimeOut = 3660`; an
existing job must be restarted to load that allowance. OS logout/shutdown may
impose its own limit. Crashes, power loss, SIGKILL and explicit force can interrupt
responses. The [protocol barrier](../reference/protocol-messages.md#provider-lifecycle-drain)
requires the updated coordinator before normal provider shutdown can be confirmed.

### `darkbloom status`

Only `--config`. Read-only. Prints the daemon snapshot (refresh cadence under
[Runtime constants](#runtime-constants)) and the last trust message the
coordinator sent; what the levels mean is in
[`architecture/security/attestation.md#trust-levels`](../architecture/security/attestation.md#trust-levels),
and how to read the line in [attestation → Verify](./attestation.md#verify).

### `darkbloom doctor`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--strict` | flag | `false` | Exit 1 on any WARN as well as FAIL |
| `--coordinator <url>` | `String?` | config URL | Coordinator for the network checks |
| `--support` | flag | `false` | Append coordinator URL, token presence, MDM state, PID-file path |
| `--clear-backend-guard` | flag | `false` | Delete `~/.darkbloom/kv-backend-guard.json`, reset the crash-loop counter in `watchdog-state.json`, exit |

Clearing restores model-aware `auto` on the next model load, not guaranteed
paged service. It preserves explicit settings, the kill switch and capability
vetoes (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/DoctorCommand.swift`,
`runClearBackendGuard`). See
[guard recovery](./troubleshooting.md#kv-backend-crash-loop-guard).

Exit 1 when any detailed check or diagnosis line is FAIL (or WARN with
`--strict`). On macOS 27 or later the diagnosis includes an `APP ATTEST`
section. It shows the daemon's local key state and launch session, and the
diagnostics from the provider's last `ready`: how the process started, how the
previous one exited, SIP and authenticated root, signing preflight, key history,
the last native Apple error chain and APNs push history. The section also
reads local `devicecheckd` log evidence; macOS lets only administrator accounts read the system log.
The check names are listed in [troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md#doctor-checks).
[`app-attest-shadow.md`](../reference/app-attest-shadow.md) defines the fields.

### `darkbloom verify`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--coordinator <url>` | `String?` | config URL | Coordinator for the network checks |

Same checks as `doctor`; any WARN or FAIL exits 1.

### `darkbloom models`

| Subcommand | Flag / positional | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `list` | `--json` | flag | `false` | Raw output |
| `list` | `--all` | flag | `false` | Include models filtered out by `backend.enabled_models` |
| `list` | `--hash <model-id>` | `String?` | `nil` | Compute the aggregate SHA-256 of one model |
| `catalog` | `--coordinator <url>` | `String?` | config URL | Catalog source |
| `catalog` | `--json` | flag | `false` | Raw output |
| `catalog` | `--type <t>` | `String?` | `nil` | Filter by `model_type` (e.g. `text`) |
| `download` | `<modelID>` | `String` | — | Catalog id (or S3 name) |
| `download` | `--coordinator <url>` | `String?` | config URL | Resolve the catalog entry |
| `download` | `--r2-cdn <url>` | `String?` | `DARKBLOOM_R2_CDN_URL`, else `https://models.darkbloom.ai` (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/ModelDownloader.swift`, `defaultR2CDNURL`) | Mirror base URL |
| `remove` | `<modelID>` | `String` | — | Model to delete from the effective model cache |
| `remove` | `--force` | flag | `false` | Skip confirmation |
| `location` | `[PATH]` | `String?` | status/menu | Select an existing readable, writable cache directory; interactive changes require `yes` |
| `location` | `--check` | flag | `false` | Inspect PATH, or the effective cache, without changing config or weights |
| `location` | `--from-env` | flag | `false` | Explicitly import the current Hugging Face environment cache once and save its absolute path |
| `location` | `--reset` | flag | `false` | Clear the saved location and restore the legacy home cache, regardless of ambient variables |

All model subcommands accept `--config <path>`. Location behavior is implemented
by `Models.Location` in `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ModelsLocationCommand.swift`;
cache precedence is specified in [model cache configuration](../reference/configuration.md#model-cache-location).

### `darkbloom local`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--json` | flag | `false` | Print the raw `~/.darkbloom/local.json` record |

Exit 1 (and `{}` in JSON mode) when no live local server is recorded
(`LocalEndpoint.readLiveInfo`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Server/LocalEndpoint.swift`).

Provider-local Chat Completions, Completions and Responses reject negative output
token limits with HTTP 400 before model invocation or streaming headers. Explicit
zero, positive and omitted limits retain their existing semantics. This local
SDK validation does not change coordinator normalization or model numerics
(`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMServer/Runtime/OpenAIRequestValidation.swift`,
`OpenAIRequestValidation.preparedRequest`).

### `darkbloom login` / `darkbloom logout`

`login` takes `--config` only and runs `performDeviceCodeLogin`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Auth/DeviceAuth.swift`): `POST
/v1/device/code`, print URL and code, poll `POST /v1/device/token`, write
`~/.darkbloom/auth_token`. `logout` takes no flags and deletes that file.

### `darkbloom benchmark`

The throughput sweep installs the same `MLXMemoryGuard` allocator limits as
serving before it loads weights. Its progress log separates active allocations,
reusable cache bytes and the active-allocation peak at each decode cell and
shutdown (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ThroughputSweep.swift`,
`run` and `runDecodeBatch`). These counters are not OS process footprint.

| Group | Flags (type = default) |
|---|---|
| Throughput | `--model <id>` (`String?`), `--prompt <text>` (`ModelBenchmark.defaultPrompt`), `--iterations <n>` (`ModelBenchmark.defaultIterations`), `--max-tokens <n>` (`ModelBenchmark.defaultMaxTokens`) |
| Ordinary token scores | `--teacher-forced-input <json>` (`String?`, unset), explicit `--model <id>` and `--kv-backend contiguous\|paged` (`BenchmarkCommand.swift`, `teacherForcedOptionError`) |
| Scheduler prefill decision | `--scheduler-prefill-decision`, `--expected-model-aggregate-sha256`, `--expected-registered-binary-sha256`, `--expected-version`, `--source-sha`, `--decision-iterations` (`SchedulerPrefillDecisionReport.minimumLiveIterations`), `--output <path>` (`BenchmarkCommand+SchedulerPrefillDecision.swift`) |
| Sweep | `--sweep`, `--prefill-lengths` (`"128,512,2048"`), `--max-batch` (`6`), `--batch-sizes` (`String?`), `--decode-tokens`, `--decode-prompt-tokens`, `--decode-iterations` (`ThroughputSweep` defaults), `--kv-backend` (`"auto"`) (`BenchmarkCommand+Sweep.swift`) |
| Scheduler prefill | `--scheduler-prefill`, `--prefill-iterations` (`2`) |
| Arrival invariance | `--arrival-invariance`, `--arrival-prompt-tokens` (`512`), `--arrival-prompt-lengths` (`String?`; exactly four comma-separated positive lengths, overrides the uniform prompt length), `--arrival-decode-tokens` (`64`), `--arrival-iterations` (`3`) (`BenchmarkCommand.swift`, `Benchmark.arrivalPromptLengths`) |
| Backend parity | `--parity`, `--assistant-model <id>` (`String?`), `--parity-max-tokens` (`48`), `--parity-prefix-tokens` (`28672`) (`BenchmarkCommand+Parity.swift`) |

`--kv-backend auto` uses the candidate's
[exact qualified-artifact allowlist](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts): eligible
cohort models try paged, all other IDs use contiguous, and automatic paged
failures or the version-bound crash-loop guard fall back to contiguous.
Explicit `--kv-backend paged` refuses construction failures rather than measuring
a fallback; the kill switch and capability/span-mask vetoes can still force
contiguous. Inspect the measured engine's `resolvedKVBackend` and report
`kvBackend` block (`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/BenchmarkCommand.swift`,
`Benchmark.kvBackend`). The
[five-artifact rollout](../design/release-090-paged-qwen-cache.md) is **not yet
validated**; benchmark selection alone is not release evidence.

Environment inputs for the harnesses are in
[`reference/configuration.md`](../reference/configuration.md).
[Model verification I/O](../reference/configuration.md#model-verification-io)
uses reusable-buffer reads and up to four independent file readers by default,
retaining complete integrity checks. It affects load/verification work, not
ordinary resident decode; explicit overrides provide the original serial path.
For a pinned GPT-OSS matrix with aggregate B=2/B=4 decode, raw token timing,
and mixed prompt arrivals, see [the profiling workflow](../developer/test.md#6-scripts-and-release-integrity).

### `darkbloom update`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--coordinator <url>` | `String?` | config URL | Release source |
| `--check-only` | flag | `false` | Report; do not install |
| `--override-quarantine` | flag | `false` | Reinstall a version quarantined after 3 failed starts |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | integer, 0–3600 | `600` | Drain the running service before activating the installed update |
| `--force` | flag | `false` | Explicitly permit interruption during update activation |

Exit 1 on `quarantined`, `busy`, `cancelled`, `downloadFailed`, `hashMismatch`,
`replaceFailed`, or a failed check (`UpdateResult`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Update/SelfUpdater.swift`).
See [installation → Update](./installation.md#update).

### `darkbloom enroll` / `darkbloom unenroll`

`EnrollmentService.enroll` in `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Auth/Enrollment.swift`
returns App Attest setup guidance on macOS 27 or later before checking profiles,
contacting the enrollment endpoint or opening Settings. Older macOS retains the
legacy profile flow. `ProviderOnboardingPolicy` in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Auth/ProviderOnboardingPolicy.swift` owns the
OS choice and the upgrade/upcoming MDM deactivation notice. The OS choice never
grants serving authorization or removes an existing profile.

| Command | Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `enroll` | `--coordinator <url>` | `String?` | config URL | Coordinator to request the profile from |
| `enroll` | `--no-open` | flag | `false` | Save the `.mobileconfig`; do not open System Settings |
| `unenroll` | `--force` | flag | `false` | Select full exit, stop the service and confirm local-data cleanup without prompting |
| `unenroll` | `--no-open` | flag | `false` | Do not open System Settings |
| `unenroll` | `--keep-serving` | flag | `false` | Require fresh coordinator App Attest removal readiness, preserve identity/account data and guide removal of only Darkbloom enrollment |

### `darkbloom logs`

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--file` | flag | `false` | Tail `~/.darkbloom/provider.log` instead of unified logging |
| `-f`, `--follow` | flag | `false` | Stream new lines |
| `--last <duration>` | `String?` | `nil` | `log show --last <duration>`; with `--follow`, history first then live stream |
| `--debug` | flag | `false` | Include debug-level entries (unified logging only) |
| `-l`, `--lines <n>` | `Int` | `50` | Lines to show; only with `--file` |

Without flags: `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "dev.darkbloom.provider"' --level info`.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--coordinator-url <url>` | Override the coordinator WebSocket URL |
| `--model <id>` | Model to serve; repeatable (skips the interactive picker) |
| `--all` | Serve all downloaded models |
| `--idle-timeout <mins>` | Idle-memory policy, saved to `[backend] idle_timeout_mins` (0 = always ready); skips the memory prompt |
| `--foreground` | Run in the foreground (used by launchd; normally implicit) |
| `--local` | Run a local OpenAI server only; do not connect to the coordinator |
| `--local-endpoint` | Serve a local OpenAI endpoint alongside the coordinator |
| `--port <port>` | Port for `--local` / `--local-endpoint` (default 8000) |
| `--bind <addr>` | Bind address for local modes (default 127.0.0.1) |
| `--no-auth` | Disable local API-key auth (trusted/airgapped only) |

| Flag | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--last <duration>` | `String` | `24h` | Window of unified logs to collect |
| `--dry-run` | flag | `false` | Print the report; do not upload |

After the model picker, an interactive `darkbloom start` asks how the machine
should treat its memory when nobody is sending requests:

```
Memory when idle
  1) Always ready    Keep models loaded (~18 GB while idle). Instant responses,
                     full base rewards.
  2) Free when idle  Unload after 60 min without requests; reload on demand
                     (~10-30 s cold start). Your Mac gets its memory back.
  3) Custom          Choose the number of idle minutes.
  Choice [2]:
```

Enter keeps the policy already in force (`Free when idle` on a fresh install).
The answer is written to `[backend] idle_timeout_mins` for coordinator-connected
idle unloading; `--model`/`--all`, `--idle-timeout`, non-interactive runs and the
launchd relaunch never prompt. See [`darkbloom idle`](#darkbloom-idle).
Every `darkbloom start` mode preloads selected models with the default
`startup_preload = true`, regardless of the idle-memory policy. A
coordinator-connected provider prioritizes previously loaded models and
defers registration for up to `startup_preload_timeout_secs`; standalone
`--local` finishes preloading before it listens. An explicit `[backend]
preload_models` list takes precedence. The slot limit and available memory
can leave models to load on a later request. `startup_preload = false`
disables preloading in either mode. The one-token `startup_selftest` and
`startup_selftest_fail_closed` settings apply only to coordinator-connected
startup; `--local` does not run a synthetic decode.

Examples:

### `darkbloom autoupdate <action>`

| Positional | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `String` | — (required) | `enable`/`on`/`true`, `disable`/`off`/`false`, or `status`; anything else exits 1 |

Writes `provider.auto_update` to the config file under the shared config lock,
reloading the file before saving so a concurrent live switch's model selection
is retained.

### `darkbloom autopilot`

Experimental memory residency for explicitly selected models; off by default.
Source: `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Autopilot/AutopilotCommand.swift` (`Autopilot`) and
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand+Autopilot.swift` (`saveAutopilotEnrollment`).
Every subcommand accepts `--config`.

| Command / option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `status`, `status --json` | Configured consent and fresh daemon state, including selected/ready models and transition result |
| `enable` | Start the model picker, download/verify selections, and safely start active experimental enrollment |
| `models` | Change the selected set through the same download/verify/drain/restart flow |
| `pause`, `resume` | Live policy update; pause preserves resident models and blocks new automatic changes |
| `pin MODEL_ID...`, `unpin MODEL_ID...` | Live update of unload protection; pins must belong to the selected set |
| `disable` | Revoke new commands and restore the saved idle policy after any accepted operation finishes |
| `start --autopilot --model ID` | Explicit scripted enrollment for the specified local model(s); repeat `--model` for multiple |
| `start --no-autopilot` | Explicitly save the ordinary idle-policy mode |

The normal interactive `start` asks **Autopilot — Experimental**, with `[y/N]`.
A blank response means No. Enrollment requires a nonempty supported selection;
`--all` cannot grant Autopilot permission. Downloads and verification finish
before enrollment is saved. Repeat starts/restarts preserve the saved decision.

The selection is an exact-build allowlist; newly discovered models and
coordinator-desired replacement builds outside it do not enroll automatically.
Use `autopilot models` to approve a replacement. While enrolled, `darkbloom switch`
returns a busy receipt with that guidance; disable Autopilot to use manual switching. Optional MTP may fall back to
target-only serving without an Autopilot download. Files stay on disk.

A compatible coordinator lease moves the provider from `waiting` to `active`.
Consent alone does not alter ordinary residency behavior. `paused` retains ready
models; `recovering` means an accepted transition is still settling. Live changes
are consumed at the next capacity poll. `models` uses the existing safe restart.
See [architecture](../architecture/model-autopilot.md) and
[operator procedures](../operations/model-autopilot.md).

## `darkbloom beta`

| Subcommand | Flag / positional | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `list` (default) | `--json` | flag | `false` | Table or JSON of every feature with `on`/`off`/`auto` |
| `status` | `[feature]` | `String?` | all | Details for one or all features |
| `enable` | `<feature>` | `String` | — | Write the feature's config key on |
| `disable` | `<feature>` | `String` | — | Write it off |

Feature ids and semantics: [beta features](./beta-features.md).

### `darkbloom fan`

| Subcommand | Flag | Type | Default | Effect | Needs `sudo` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` (default) | `--json` | flag | `false` | Helper install/load state, policy, temperatures | no |
| `diagnose` | `--json` | flag | `false` | Fans and GPU sensors detected | no |
| `enable` | `--speed <pct>` | `Double` | `80` | Target, % of each fan's maximum; `60`–`90` accepted | yes |
| `enable` | `--temperature <C>` | `Double` | `45` | Engage threshold; release is `--temperature − 5` | yes |
| `configure` | `--speed <pct>` | `Double?` | `nil` | Change speed only | yes |
| `configure` | `--temperature <C>` | `Double?` | `nil` | Change threshold only; at least one of the two is required | yes |
| `disable` | — | | | Restore automatic control; keep the helper installed | yes |
| `uninstall` | — | | | Restore automatic control; remove helper and LaunchDaemon | yes |
| `test-lease` (**debug builds only, hidden**) | `--seconds <n>` | `Int` | `30` | Hold a provider activity lease for 1–300 s | no |

## `darkbloom idle`

Manage the idle-memory policy: whether a model stays loaded while the machine
receives no requests, or is unloaded to give the memory back and reloaded on
demand. The single source of truth is `[backend] idle_timeout_mins` in
`provider.toml` (0 = always ready); `darkbloom start`'s memory prompt and
`--idle-timeout` write the same key, and the launchd plist never carries it.

```bash
darkbloom idle status                 # current policy and where it is set (default)
darkbloom idle keep-loaded            # always ready: models stay loaded
darkbloom idle unload-after <minutes> # free when idle: unload after N idle minutes (1..10080)
```

| Policy | `idle_timeout_mins` | Effect |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Always ready | `0` | Models stay resident; instant responses; the machine stays eligible for base rewards the whole time |
| Free when idle (default) | `60` | A model with no requests for 60 min is unloaded; the next request reloads it (~10-30 s cold start) |
| Custom | `N` | Same as above with an `N`-minute window |

Changes are saved with the same locked read-modify-write as `darkbloom beta`
and take effect after `darkbloom restart`. The provider reports the policy in
its heartbeat (`idle_unload_mins`) so the dashboard shows an empty slot as
"sleeping, wakes on demand" rather than as a fault. `--json` prints the policy
machine-readably.

## `darkbloom stop`

Drain accepted requests and their terminal usage before persistently stopping
the launchd service.

```bash
darkbloom stop [--timeout <seconds>] [--force] [--uninstall]
```

| Flag | Type / valid range | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--timeout <seconds>` | integer, 0–3600 | `600` | Wait for accepted coordinator requests, local response writes and the coordinator acknowledgement |
| `--force` | flag | `false` | Explicitly permit bounded cancellation and termination of unfinished work |
| `--uninstall` | flag | `false` | After draining or explicit force, remove the provider and watchdog plists |

The command disarms the watchdog and disables login/reboot startup before
requesting the drain. If setup fails before the mailbox request is published,
it restores the prior launchd/watchdog recovery state and retains its history. A normal drain timeout returns non-success and leaves the
process draining with automatic restart disabled. Repeat `stop` or `restart`
with a new deadline, or explicitly pass `--force`. Interrupting the CLI does not
cancel accepted inference or reopen admission. A running provider without the
drain control protocol requires an upgrade or an explicit forced interruption.

Code: `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServiceDrain.swift` (`DrainOptions`,
`ServiceDrain.prepare`) and `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/StopCommand.swift`
(`Stop`). See [graceful lifecycle behavior](#graceful-stop-and-restart) for signal
handling and launchd's termination allowance.

## `darkbloom restart`

Drain accepted work, reload the recorded launchd configuration, and confirm a
new provider process with fresh serving authorization. The coordinator URL,
model selection and provider config arguments are preserved.

```bash
darkbloom restart [--timeout <seconds>] [--force] [--startup-timeout <seconds>] [--config <path>]
```

| Flag | Type / valid range | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--timeout <seconds>` | integer, 0–3600 | `600` | Wait for accepted work and the coordinator acknowledgement before restarting |
| `--force` | flag | `false` | Explicitly permit interruption of unfinished work before restarting |
| `--startup-timeout <seconds>` | integer, 1–3600 | `180` | Wait for a new process identity and fresh App Attest, legacy, or owner self-route authorization |
| `--config <path>` | path | unset | Override the config used to re-arm the watchdog; the provider keeps its recorded config arguments |

A drain timeout returns non-success and leaves the old process draining with
automatic restart disabled; repeat the command with a new deadline or explicitly
choose `--force`. A startup timeout returns non-success while the new service
keeps starting, without issuing another restart. Inspect `darkbloom status` to
check its progress. An installed, stopped service is started; a missing service
returns non-success. The watchdog is re-armed according to `provider.auto_restart`.
A foreground/local process is explicitly terminated after draining before the
saved launchd configuration starts. If no launchd configuration exists, restart
refuses before disturbing that process; use `start` to choose a replacement.
Owner-only/preferred-owner connections may confirm `self_route` authorization;
this does not claim public-fleet eligibility.

Code: `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServiceDrain.swift` (`DrainOptions`,
`ServiceDrain.waitForRestart`) and
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/RestartCommand.swift` (`Restart`).

## `darkbloom status`

Show local configuration, hardware, schedule, and live daemon state.

```bash
darkbloom status
```

Output includes:

- Provider version and config path.
- Coordinator URL and backend settings.
- Detected hardware (chip, RAM, GPU cores).
- Schedule state (active/inactive).
- Live daemon PID, uptime, trust verdict, and last model-load error.
- `Memory when idle`: the idle-memory policy in force (`always ready` or
  `free after N idle`). Advertised models without a resident engine are
  separated into `Startup preload pending` and `Not loaded (loads on request)`.
- Per-slot posture: the KV backend each loaded model actually resolved to
  (`paged` / `contiguous`), the selection the config asked for, and whether
  MTP is enabled, active, or enabled-but-inert.

### Slot posture

```
Slot posture: state written 2s ago
  google/gemma-4-26b: kv=paged (requested paged) | mtp=enabled, active
  openai/gpt-oss-20b: kv=contiguous (requested auto) | mtp=enabled but INERT (inert_kv_unsupported)
  big/model-70b: kv=NOT SERVING (requested paged) — load failed: …
```

`requested` is what `engine_v2_kv_backend` (or a per-model override in
`engine_v2_kv_backend_by_model`) asked for; the `kv=` value is what the
engine was actually built with. They differ when a request was vetoed,
degraded, or refused — an explicitly requested `paged` backend that cannot
be built REFUSES the load rather than serving contiguous, so that model
shows `kv=NOT SERVING`.

`mtp=enabled but INERT` means a drafter is resident and charging memory
while producing no drafts. It is not the same state as `mtp=enabled,
active`, and the reason is always named.

These values come from the daemon's state file
(`~/.darkbloom/daemon-state.json`, override with `DARKBLOOM_STATE_FILE`),
which the running daemon rewrites every `heartbeat_interval_secs / 2`
seconds — about every 2 s at the default. The header carries the snapshot's
age, and the block is prefixed `STALE` once it has gone unrefreshed for
four write cycles: a value from before a reload is worse than no value.

## `darkbloom doctor`

Run local diagnostics and fetch the coordinator's trust view.

```bash
darkbloom doctor [--strict] [--coordinator <url>] [--support] [--clear-backend-guard]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--strict` | Treat warnings as failures |
| `--coordinator <url>` | Override coordinator URL for remote checks |
| `--support` | Print local identifiers useful for support |
| `--clear-backend-guard` | Remove the crash-loop KV guard, reset its restart chain and exit; normal selection resumes on the next load |

`darkbloom doctor` is read-only except for the subprocess calls used by public
ProviderCore checks and the explicit `--clear-backend-guard` action
(`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/DoctorCommand.swift`, `runClearBackendGuard`).

Two of the detailed checks cover the KV-backend rollout:

| Check | Fails when |
|-------|-----------|
| `daemon state freshness` | The daemon is running but has not rewritten its state file for eight write periods — it is wedged, and every live value below it is a guess. The bar is derived from `heartbeat_interval_secs` (the daemon writes every half-heartbeat) with a 90 s floor, so raising the heartbeat does not make a healthy daemon look wedged. |
| `kv backend posture` | An EXPLICIT `paged` or `contiguous` request was not honoured: refused (no engine built, the box serves nothing for that model) or silently degraded to another backend. |

`auto` never fails this check — it promises nothing, so whichever backend it
lands on is honoured by definition. Candidate `auto` can report paged for the
[exact qualified-artifact cohort](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts), or contiguous
after fallback; non-cohort `auto` remains contiguous. None is a posture fault
or validation of the candidate rollout. Explicit `paged` construction failures
refuse the load; a policy veto that serves contiguous instead still fails the
explicit-request posture check. When
the state file is past the wedge bar the backend verdict is WITHHELD rather
than asserted from a snapshot that may predate a reload.

An explicit `engine_v2_kv_backend` with no slot behind it — startup preload
off, or every slot idle-unloaded — WARNs rather than passes: nothing on the
box has loaded, let alone proved, the backend it was configured for. Under
`--strict` (and therefore `darkbloom verify`) that warning exits non-zero,
which is the point: an unproven paged rollout must not certify.

## `darkbloom verify`

Equivalent to a strict `doctor` run. Any warning or failure exits non-zero.

```bash
darkbloom verify [--coordinator <url>]
```

## `darkbloom models`

Manage locally cached MLX models.

### `darkbloom models catalog`

Show the coordinator's supported-model catalog.

```bash
darkbloom models catalog [--coordinator <url>] [--json] [--type <type>]
```

### `darkbloom models list`

List local models.

```bash
darkbloom models list [--json] [--all] [--hash <model-id>]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--all` | Show every discovered model, ignoring `enabled_models` |
| `--hash <model-id>` | Compute an on-demand integrity hash for one model |

### `darkbloom models download <id>`

Download a model from the coordinator catalog.

```bash
darkbloom models download <id> [--coordinator <url>] [--r2-cdn <url>]
```

### `darkbloom models remove <id>`

Delete a downloaded model.

```bash
darkbloom models remove <id> [--force]
```

### `darkbloom models location`

Inspect a cache or explicitly save its location in `provider.toml`
(`Models.Location`, `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ModelsLocationCommand.swift`).
No beta flag is involved. Without a saved location, existing providers continue
using the legacy cache even if Hugging Face/XDG variables are exported.

```bash
darkbloom models location                              # terminal menu; status otherwise
darkbloom models location /Volumes/Models/hub           # explicitly save an existing hub root
darkbloom models location --from-env                    # explicitly import and pin the current HF cache
darkbloom models location --check /Volumes/Models/hub   # inspect only; never opts in
darkbloom models location --reset                       # restore the legacy default; retain all weights
```

The menu offers keeping the current location, restoring the default, choosing a
custom path, or importing the detected environment cache. Enter/EOF cancels;
terminal changes require `yes`. An explicit PATH or `--from-env` also works
noninteractively. `--from-env` cannot be combined with PATH, `--check`, or `--reset`.
An import pins the resolved absolute directory; later environment changes cannot
switch it. No valid cache variable means no import and no saved change. See the
[one-time import precedence](../reference/configuration.md#model-cache-location).

Empty writable directories are valid for future downloads. Missing directories
are not created: mount the external volume and create the intended directory
explicitly first. Nothing moves or deletes existing weights, downloads models,
or restarts a running provider. `--reset` returns to the legacy home cache even
when cache environment variables remain set.

Before applying a selection, inspect the chosen directory and confirm the
expected model IDs. `--check` can succeed for an empty writable directory; it is
discovery, not weight-integrity verification or network eligibility. Use
`models list --hash <model-id>` for an on-demand aggregate hash and `doctor` for
serving diagnostics.

After saving, apply the configuration with `darkbloom restart`, or `darkbloom
start` if stopped. Use the intended `--config <path>` on the location command and
`start` for a custom config; restart retains the installed job's config argument.
The CLI reports the selected config, not a running daemon's already-loaded state.

## `darkbloom benchmark`

Run a standardized local inference benchmark.

```bash
darkbloom benchmark [--model <id>] [--prompt <text>] [--iterations <n>] [--max-tokens <n>]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--model <id>` | Model to benchmark (defaults to the largest model that fits) |
| `--prompt <text>` | Prompt text |
| `--iterations <n>` | Number of iterations (default from `ModelBenchmark`) |
| `--max-tokens <n>` | Maximum tokens to generate per iteration |

For native Qwen4 model types, the ordinary command uses the production CBv2
model/factory path with MTP and prefix caching off. It preserves model/tokenizer
EOS, checks complete weight integrity before and after load, and releases the
session between independent runs. Non-native model types keep their generic path
and JSON5 configuration support (`ModelBenchmark.run`,
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/ModelBenchmarkNativeQwen4.swift`).
Iteration/output counts must be positive. The prefill column measures time to
the first generated token, including prompt preparation; model loading and
integrity hashing are outside the reported iteration time. An eight-token
smoke proves entry-point operation, not sustained decode performance.

For `diffusion_gemma`, the ordinary command uses the
[native block benchmark](../architecture/native-block-inference.md#ordinary-cli-benchmark).
`--kv-backend auto|contiguous|paged` selects storage (`auto` remains contiguous).
The prefill column is encoder prefill, not time to first output. Each
`NATIVE_BLOCK_BENCHMARK` JSON row separately reports first committed output,
generation including first-block work, completion usage including EOS, committed
tokens excluding EOS, resolved backend and the production KV grant. Native framing
can be included in committed tokens; the row does not certify a visible-token
performance target. Loading and its integrity hashes have a separate clock.
The row also exposes existing native execution/prefill quantum counts,
post-first-block commit count and quantum wall-time sum/maximum. Those are work
diagnostics, not output tokens or GPU-only timing. Prefill, refinement and
committed-block re-encoding all contribute native work; do not count the
execution-quanta total as refinement passes without separating those phases.
Emitting these counters adds no sampling or GPU evaluation step.
AR sweep, scheduler-prefill, arrival, teacher-forcing and parity modes reject this
architecture instead of substituting an autoregressive iterator.

Eligible native inference uses the SDK's
[ordered expert-output reduction](../reference/configuration.md#native-diffusiongemma-expert-reduction).
That reference defines `DARKBLOOM_DIFFUSION_EXPERT_UNSORT` and its explicit
rollback. Compare warmed original/optimized runs with unchanged artifact,
prompt, seed and denoising controls; cold JIT timings and isolated kernel
timings do not establish a request-throughput improvement.

For an exclusive native benchmark, the
[descriptor-route diagnostic](../reference/configuration.md#native-diffusiongemma-expert-reduction)
adds `DIFFUSION_PROVIDER_ROUTE` rows. It observes the first iteration and checks
that counters stay disarmed for subsequent iterations; it does not remove the
first sample from the ordinary output. Configure expert routing through
`[gemma_optimizations].weighted_r1`; the benchmark refuses conflicting low-level
environment overrides. DiffusionGemma's separate expert reduction control remains
independent of the Gemma-specific weighted-unsort setting.
The same reference documents opt-in soft-conditioning and native compiled-sampler
candidates. `softEmbeddingCalls` and `compiledSamplerCalls` prove dispatch in the
observed first iteration; subsequent iterations must retain the disarmed counts.
Report first-use compilation separately from warmed results. An environment value alone does not
prove shape eligibility or a request-throughput gain. Keep native weights,
sampling, canvas and output-count oracles identical when comparing either route.

### Teacher-forced scores

`--teacher-forced-input <json>` selects bounded ordinary target scoring with an
explicit model and backend. The UTF-8 JSON input is at most 1 MiB; fields are
defined by `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/TeacherForcedBenchmarkInput.swift`
(`TeacherForcedBenchmarkInput`):

| Field | Required value |
|---|---|
| `modelID` | Exact selected model ID |
| `expectedModelAggregateSHA256` | Verified model aggregate hash, 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters |
| `promptTokens` | Exact nonempty token-ID array, at most 32,768 IDs |
| `continuation` | Exact nonempty token-ID array, at most 256 IDs |

IDs must fit the model's declared vocabulary; the native request bounds and
actual logit geometry are checked by
`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/ContinuousBatchingV2/CBv2TeacherForcedScores.swift`.
This mode disables prefix caching and MTP, uses a production single-slot KV
grant, and refuses backend fallback. It is mutually exclusive with the other
benchmark modes and rejects `--assistant-model` and `--output`; JSON goes to
stdout (`BenchmarkCommand.swift`, `teacherForcedOptionError`).

The report includes plain top-1 IDs, two diagnostic observations, forward
counts, runtime/input/model hashes and the production grant. `observed` means
finite scores and matching ordinary-forward controls; `inconclusive` preserves
evidence and exits 2. Neither status certifies free generation, model quality
or speculative verification
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderBenchmark/TeacherForcedBenchmark.swift`).
See the [developer test procedure](../developer/test.md#ordinary-teacher-forced-score-diagnostics).

## `darkbloom update`

Check for and apply provider updates.

```bash
darkbloom update [--check-only] [--coordinator <url>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--force]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--check-only` | Report whether an update is available without installing |
| `--coordinator <url>` | Override coordinator URL |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Drain deadline: default `600`, valid 0–3600 seconds |
| `--force` | Explicitly permit interruption during activation; default `false` |

The update path verifies bundle, binary, and `mlx.metallib` hashes before
replacing the running binary (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Update/SelfUpdater.swift`).

## `darkbloom autoupdate`

Enable or disable automatic update checks at startup.

```bash
darkbloom autoupdate <enable|disable|status>
```

This toggles `provider.auto_update` in `provider.toml`. It reloads the file
under the same sidecar lock as `darkbloom switch`, preserving a selection saved
by a concurrent switch.

## `darkbloom beta`

Manage configurable beta features. Defaults are feature-specific: the selected
Gemma optimizations default on, while reserved/opt-in features default off.
Provider TOML is authoritative for every serve mode. The Gemma defaults and
missing-key decode are defined in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationSettings.swift:16-34`,
with the missing-section fallback in
`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift:397-400`.
The shared pre-Metal projection is
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/ServeRuntimePreparer.swift:24-35`.

```bash
darkbloom beta list                 # all features + on/off (default subcommand)
darkbloom beta status [feature]     # details for all features, or one
darkbloom beta enable <feature>     # turn on (then: darkbloom restart)
darkbloom beta disable <feature>    # turn off
```

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `gemma-prefill-layer18` | Default-on layer-18 prefill submission; disable and restart for legacy submission behavior |
| `gemma-weighted-r1` | Default-on atomic weighted-unsort + safe-R1 pair; disable and restart to roll back both |
| `mtp` | MTP policy. Default `auto` drafts automatically for Qwen 3.5-family checkpoints that embed their head (`mtplx_mtp` in `config.json`); auto also enables the catalog `spec_dec` assistant for exact `gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit`; explicit on enables other supported targets; explicit off is the rollback |

`enable`/`disable` read-modify-write the TOML config and report whether a restart
is required. Restart is the activation boundary for process-wide optimization
state. The durable locked write and restart instruction are implemented in
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/BetaCommand.swift:201-235`. See
[Beta Features](beta-features.md) for the full guide. `darkbloom beta list` also
accepts `--json`. Under the default `auto` mode a served checkpoint that embeds its MTP head
drafts without any beta toggle. Exact `gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit` also resolves its
external assistant automatically; other checkpoints without an embedded
declaration stay target-only. Missing or invalid assistants fall back to ordinary
decode. Standalone serving also downloads the verified assistant in the background,
using the configured `coordinator.url` catalog, and activates it only when the
current engine is idle. Existing requests keep their engine; insufficient memory
or preparation failure preserves target-only serving. Local parity results are not
a blanket M1-M3/unknown-chip certification.
The published assistant metadata is visible in the
[public production catalog](https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/models/catalog?type=text)
under `gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit.metadata.spec_dec`.
`kv-quant` was removed in v0.8.0 and is no longer a valid feature id.

## `darkbloom fan` (experimental)

Inspect or opt into provider-only temperature-based fan control.

```bash
darkbloom fan status [--json]
darkbloom fan diagnose [--json]
sudo darkbloom fan enable [--speed 80] [--temperature 45]
sudo darkbloom fan configure [--speed 60...90] [--temperature C]
sudo darkbloom fan disable
sudo darkbloom fan uninstall
```

Ordinary Darkbloom installation leaves the bundled helper dormant. State changes
require explicit `sudo`; read-only status and diagnostics do not. The helper
applies a target only while a signed provider holds an activity lease and a
validated GPU sensor exceeds the threshold. Defaults are 80% of each fan's
reported maximum, engage at 45 C, and release below 40 C. See
[Experimental Fan Control](fan-control.md) for hardware gates and recovery
behavior.

## `darkbloom login`

Link this machine to a Darkbloom account via RFC 8628 device-code flow.

```bash
darkbloom login
```

## `darkbloom logout`

Unlink this machine from its Darkbloom account.

```bash
darkbloom logout
```

## `darkbloom enroll`

Request and install the Darkbloom MDM / device-attestation profile.

```bash
darkbloom enroll [--coordinator <url>] [--no-open]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--coordinator <url>` | Override coordinator URL |
| `--no-open` | Download the profile but do not open System Settings |

## `darkbloom unenroll`

Without a flag, ask whether to fully exit Darkbloom or remove only MDM and keep serving with App Attest. Enter or closed input cancels without changing anything. The App Attest option requires macOS 27 or later and fresh coordinator removal approval; an unsupported/unqualified choice never falls back to cleanup.

Full exit stops the launchd provider and disables its automatic restart before profile-removal guidance and a separate local cleanup confirmation. If a foreground provider is still running, cleanup is refused. The cleanup list includes the current and legacy Secure Enclave signing keys. Model downloads and server-side account history remain intact.

If profile inventory needs administrator access, run this command in the foreground of an interactive terminal. `sudo` prompts there with terminal echo disabled; only the fixed, read-only profile inventory command is elevated. A denied prompt, noninteractive session, or background terminal job withholds profile-removal guidance. The command does not remove a profile itself; confirm the exact Darkbloom profile in System Settings. See [`attestation.md`](./attestation.md#app-attest-without-darkbloom-mdm).

Code: `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/UnenrollCommand+Choice.swift` (`chooseUnenrollmentMode`, `performUnenrollment`); `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/UnenrollCommand.swift` (`performFullUnenrollment`). Noninteractive use requires an explicit mode flag.

```bash
darkbloom unenroll [--force] [--no-open]
darkbloom unenroll --keep-serving [--no-open]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | Select full exit and confirm local cleanup; cannot combine with `--keep-serving` |
| `--no-open` | Do not open System Settings |
| `--keep-serving` | Select macOS 27+ App Attest migration directly, retaining account/keys/data |

## `darkbloom local`

Print the local (direct-mode) OpenAI endpoint URL and API key.

```bash
darkbloom local [--json]
```

`darkbloom local` reads `~/.darkbloom/local.json`, but only advertises it if the
recorded server process is still alive.

## `darkbloom logs`

Show provider logs from macOS unified logging or the legacy log file.

```bash
darkbloom logs [--file] [--follow] [--last <duration>] [--debug] [--lines <n>]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--file` | Read from the legacy log file instead of unified logging |
| `--follow`, `-f` | Stream new lines |
| `--last <duration>` | Historical window, e.g. `1h`, `30m`, `24h` |
| `--debug` | Include debug-level messages |
| `--lines <n>` | Number of lines (only with `--file`) |

Boot-security diagnostics pass only when SIP and authenticated root are both positively enabled. A missing reading produces a warning, and failed diagnostic commands time out with unknown fields. APNs history is rendered under APNs code-identity readiness on all supported macOS versions, even without an App Attest snapshot. An absent history file is omitted. Zero observed pushes is `[INFO]` with an indeterminate delivery result, not a warning: cached code identity may avoid APNs entirely. Informational results do not fail `--strict`. A recorded App Attest `environment_mismatch` fails the signing diagnostic even when the entitlement is a known production/development value. APNs token presence follows late callbacks; a recorded reply means the local WebSocket write completed, not that the coordinator verified it.

## `darkbloom report`

Collect recent Darkbloom provider unified logs and explicitly upload them to the
coordinator for troubleshooting.

```bash
darkbloom report [--last <duration>] [--dry-run]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--last <duration>` | Time window, e.g. `1h`, `6h`, `24h` |
| `--dry-run` | Print the exact report locally without uploading |

The assembled upload reserves room for App Attest evidence within the coordinator's 10 MiB raw-body limit; older provider-log lines are trimmed as needed. `--dry-run` prints this same bounded payload.

The command runs only when invoked by the provider operator. It collects the
`dev.darkbloom.provider` subsystem, preserves macOS unified-log privacy
redaction, and does not include debug-level messages. Automatic report upload is
disabled.

The device-wide log collector allows 30 seconds, then a 250 ms termination grace before killing an unresponsive child. A timeout returns unavailable evidence without an unbounded wait (`DeviceCheckEvidence.runLog`). Reads retain at most the newest 8 MiB of stdout and 4 KiB of stderr. Parsing skips lines over 64 KiB and retains only the newest 200 matching events in a ring; the output describes the collected log tail rather than claiming complete two-hour coverage.

It also appends App Attest evidence as extra NDJSON lines:

- the daemon's local App Attest snapshot (`source`
  `darkbloom.app_attest_state`), with key history refreshed after each proof,
  ages advanced to report time, process start and the native error chain;
- the APNs push receipt/reply summary;
- device-wide `devicecheckd` / `com.apple.appattest` observations from the last
  2 h (`source` `darkbloom.devicecheck_evidence`). Every outcome carries
  `scope=device_wide` and `attribution=not_attributable_to_darkbloom`: other apps
  can cause these events, so they do not establish this provider's key state.
  Only timestamp, category, message type and closed-pattern numeric matches
  remain, such as `SecKeyCreateSignature failed`, `CryptoTokenKit Code`,
  `AKSError`, `Should fetch CD hash`, `invalidKey` and `unknownSystemFailure`.
  Message text, key identifiers and paths are dropped.

macOS lets only administrator accounts read the system log. From a standard
account, macOS answers `Operation not permitted`. The command reports this and
still uploads the App Attest snapshot. To include the logs, run it from an
administrator account, or run `sudo darkbloom report` if this account is allowed
to use sudo. Under `sudo` it reads the invoking user's daemon state and provider
config (unless `--config` is given), plus canonical then legacy credentials
through `AuthTokenStore.loadReadOnly`. It does not migrate config or token files
as root. An explicit nonempty `DARKBLOOM_AUTH_TOKEN_PATH` overrides that lookup
and suppresses legacy fallback. See `ReportAppAttestEvidence` in
`provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Diagnostics/`. `--dry-run` prints every appended
line before anything is uploaded.

### `provider.toml` keys read by the CLI

Defaults are the `ProviderConfig` initialisers
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift`); a missing
key decodes to its default, and that file is the complete schema (this table
lists the keys an operator is likely to set). Environment variables, which
override `provider.toml` for one process, are in
[`reference/configuration.md`](../reference/configuration.md#provider-cli-darkbloom).

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `[provider] memory_reserve_gb` | `4` | Unified memory withheld from model admission |
| `[provider] auto_update` | `true` | Startup + periodic self-update |
| `[provider] auto_restart` | `true` | Arm the watchdog LaunchAgent |
| `[provider] update_jitter_seconds` | `300` | Max random delay before an automatic install or a network provider drains a model for a prepared MTP replacement; serving continues during the delay. `0` disables jitter; capped at `3600`. Standalone MTP upgrades skip this delay. Random staggering provides no fleet availability guarantee (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift`, `updateJitterSeconds`; `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Update/UpdateJitter.swift`, `delay`; `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+MTPDrain.swift`, `waitBeforeMTPUpgradeDrain`) |
| `[backend] enabled_models` | `[]` | Advertise only these ids; empty = all serveable |
| `[backend] model_cache_directory` | unset | Explicit saved hub directory; set or import once with `models location`, clear with `--reset`. Ambient cache variables never override it; hand-written relative paths are anchored to the config file (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ModelCacheConfiguration.swift`, `ConfigManager.modelCacheDirectory`) |
| `[backend] idle_timeout_mins` | `60` | Unload a model idle this long; `0` disables; paused during active or explicitly paused Autopilot |
| `[backend] max_model_slots` | `3` | Resident models |
| `[backend] engine_v2_max_concurrent` | `4` (clamped to `[1, 8]`) | Concurrent requests per engine |
| `[backend] engine_v2_kv_backend` | `"auto"` | `auto` / `paged` / `contiguous`; per-model table `engine_v2_kv_backend_by_model` takes precedence. Candidate `auto` tries paged only for the [exact qualified-artifact allowlist](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts), with contiguous fallback; all other IDs remain contiguous (`EngineV2KVBackendPolicy.parseSelection`, `preferredBackend`) |
| `[backend] mtp_mode` | `auto` | Written by `darkbloom beta enable|disable mtp` |
| `[backend.model_autopilot] enabled` | `false` | Experimental explicit consent; a nonempty selected set and activation lease are required (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Autopilot/ModelAutopilotSettings.swift`) |
| `[backend.model_autopilot] min_dwell_seconds` | `1800` | Minimum residence before Autopilot replacement; runtime clamps to `60...86400` (`ModelAutopilotSettings.effectiveMinDwellSeconds`) |
| `[backend.model_autopilot] pinned_models` | `[]` | Models autopilot must retain; configured `[backend] model` is additionally pinned (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Autopilot/ProviderLoop+Autopilot.swift`, `autopilotPinnedModels`) |
| `[backend] startup_preload` | `true` | Preload `preload_models` when set, otherwise selected models (previously loaded first on coordinator starts), within slot and memory limits |
| `[coordinator] url` | `"wss://api.darkbloom.dev/ws/provider"` | |
| `[coordinator] heartbeat_interval_secs` | `5` | Heartbeat; state file refresh is half of it |
| `[coordinator] private_only` | `false` | Serve only the owner's [self-route](./self-route.md) traffic |
| `[gemma_optimizations] prefill_layer18`, `weighted_r1` | `true` | See [beta features](./beta-features.md) |
| `config_version` | written by the CLI | Schema stamp for one-time migrations |
| `[backend] continuous_batching`, `adaptive_prefill`, `engine_v2`, `legacy_compiled_decode`, `kv_quant` | retired | Parsed for presence only; one startup WARN each (`RetiredCodingKeys`) |

## LaunchAgent environment passthrough

Model-cache locations are read from `provider.toml`; Hugging Face/XDG cache
variables are neither forwarded nor runtime overrides. The optional
[`--from-env` import](#darkbloom-models-location) saves an absolute path once,
so the foreground CLI and daemon use the same explicitly selected directory.

The [Bonsai performance profile](../reference/configuration.md#bonsai-performance-qualification)
uses source-default-on eligible paths in foreground and daemon processes. It
leaves model bytes, native precision, context limits and MTP capabilities unchanged.
Explicit `0` restores the prior path; other explicit values except `1` also
disable it. These names are not daemon shell-environment passthrough entries:
foreground overrides work, but do not assume a shell setting reaches an installed
LaunchAgent. The generic constant-cache kill switch remains effective.

For native Flash-Next foreground/local serving, the lower-only
`DARKBLOOM_QWEN4_LISTING_CONTEXT` control bounds the complete request envelope.
Its parsing, default and mandatory PLE acceptance setting are in the
[candidate configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#native-flash-next-candidate).
The same reference describes the default Qwen4 full-KV/PV32/layer-submission
profile and its explicit `0` rollback controls. It primarily affects decode and
short MTP verification, not larger prefill chunks. These Qwen-specific controls
are not in the daemon passthrough list below: source defaults apply there,
while shell overrides require foreground/local serving. This candidate adds
no release or catalog command.

`darkbloom start` copies only these variables from the invoking shell into the
provider plist's `EnvironmentVariables`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/LaunchAgent.swift`,
`passthroughEnvKeys` + `inferencePassthroughEnvKeys`,
`passthroughEnvironment`). Every other variable — including `PATH` and all the
media, SSD-prefix and memory-cap tunables — reaches the engine only under
`darkbloom start --foreground` or `--local`. The `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE` switch
defaults to enabled for the exact Qwen, Nemotron Lightning and Bonsai 2 artifacts,
Gemma 4 26B QAT (`gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit`) and GPT-OSS 20B (`gpt-oss-20b`); see
[prefix-cache defaults](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts). Other models need an
explicit affirmative value for SSD caching. Resident payload retention requires
`DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY=1`; both switches are forwarded to the daemon,
and the global disable wins (`PrefixCachePolicy.isEnabled`, `isMemoryEnabled`). Coordinator cache preference separately requires
`EIGENINFERENCE_CACHE_ROUTING_MODE=on`; its default is `off`, and no provider CLI
cache setting enables it (`coordinator/registry/config.go`, `ReadConfig`). Resident
routing also requires the separate live capability described in
[`cache-aware-routing.md`](../architecture/cache-aware-routing.md). Effects and defaults are specified
once in [`reference/configuration.md`](../reference/configuration.md).

`DARKBLOOM_CBV2_HYBRID_PREFIX_CACHE` and `DARKBLOOM_CBV2_HYBRID_PREFIX_BYTES`
control the explicitly opted-in recurrent checkpoint bank in foreground/local processes; they are
not forwarded into the LaunchAgent. Their defaults and budget semantics are
listed in the
[`resident cache configuration`](../reference/configuration.md#resident-recurrent-prefix-cache)
table (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Hybrid.swift`,
`hybridConfig`). They do not change `mtp_mode`; eligible persistent assistants
must support the checkpoint contract described in
[`prefix caching`](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#resident-tiers).

| Variable | Read by |
|---|---|
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_MEMORY` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Activation.swift` (`memoryEnvironmentFlag`) |
| `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy+Activation.swift` (`environmentFlag`) |

| `MLX_GATHER_QMM_EXPERT_SLICES` | only when the shell value is exactly `1` (`GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.daemonDrainPassthrough`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/GemmaOptimizationEnvironment.swift`) |

The watchdog plist carries its own list: `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`,
`DARKBLOOM_STATE_FILE`, `DARKBLOOM_WATCHDOG_STATE`, `DARKBLOOM_KV_BACKEND_GUARD`
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/WatchdogAgent.swift`).
`DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` is **not** forwarded to the provider daemon; disable
automatic updates with `darkbloom autoupdate disable`.
