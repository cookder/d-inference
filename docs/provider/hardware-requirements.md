# Provider hardware requirements

> Last updated: 2026-09-27 · commit `a2ec0da03`

Reference for what a Mac needs to run the `darkbloom` provider: the minimum
requirements, the chip families the provider distinguishes, which catalog
models load at each unified-memory size, and the disk and thermal behaviour an
operator has to plan for. For operators choosing or checking a machine. The
memory constants and the load-gate arithmetic behind the RAM table are stated
once in [`../architecture/hardware-support.md`](../architecture/hardware-support.md)
and are not repeated here.

## Minimum requirements

Native DiffusionGemma retains its vision tower and applies the existing per-frame
allocation checks and shared process budget; enabling media discovery does not
lower load, activation or KV reserves. See the [native block memory and media
contract](../architecture/native-block-inference.md). No new physical RAM-tier
or throughput guarantee follows from the capability flag.

| Component | Requirement | Code |
|---|---|---|
| CPU / GPU | Apple Silicon with Metal; `ChipFamily` recognised: `M1`, `M2`, `M3`, `M4`, `M5`, `M6` (`Unknown` still runs) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Engine/GPUEnforcement.swift` (`requireMetal`), `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Protocol/Enums.swift` |
| Architecture | `arm64` only; the installer refuses Intel Macs | `coordinator/api/install.sh` |
| RAM | At least 8 GB to start at all ([`../architecture/hardware-support.md#context`](../architecture/hardware-support.md#context)); per-model needs below | `provider-swift/Sources/darkbloom/Start/StartCommand+Preflight.swift` (`hardware.memoryGb < 8`) |
| macOS | 14 (Sonoma) or later, the build floor; `darkbloom doctor` warns below macOS 26 (`recommendedMacOSMajorVersion`, [`../architecture/hardware-support.md#context`](../architecture/hardware-support.md#context)) but does not block | `provider-swift/Package.swift` (`.macOS(.v14)`), `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Security/BootSecurity.swift` |
| Storage | Weights per model (catalog `size_gb`) under the Hugging Face hub cache, plus the SSD prefix-cache budget (`ssdDiskBudgetBytes`, [`../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules`](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules)) when that cache is active | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/ModelScanner.swift` (`defaultCacheDirectory`), `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy.swift` |
| Network | Outbound `wss://api.darkbloom.dev/ws/provider` and HTTPS on 443; a heartbeat every `heartbeat_interval_secs` ([`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli)); no inbound port | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift` |
| Security posture | SIP enabled and Full Security boot; a logged-in GUI session for APNs code-identity attestation | [`attestation.md`](./attestation.md) |

## Bonsai 2 qualification scope

The unchanged Prism Bonsai 2 27B MLX 2-bit payload is 8,595,477,990 bytes,
including its vision tensors. File size is not a RAM-tier qualification:
activation/KV reserves and live OS headroom remain required. The initial draft
targets M5 Max testing; no minimum-RAM catalog value, full-context guarantee or
MTP capability is introduced. `EngineV2KVBackendPolicy` selects paging for the
exact artifact ID; all existing admission checks remain in effect. The artifact
contract is in `libs/mlx-swift-lm/docs/bonsai2.md`.

## Chip families

| Family | Recognised as | Behaviour that differs |
|---|---|---|
| M1, M2 | `ChipFamily.m1`, `.m2` | MTP `maxRectangularTokens = 4` (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/MTP/MTPAutomaticVerificationPolicy.swift`) |
| M3, M4 | `.m3`, `.m4` | MTP `maxRectangularTokens = 8` |
| M5 | `.m5` | As M3/M4, plus the provider advertises runtime capability `apple_m5` (and `mlx_nax` when the NAX kernels are available); the catalog's `required_provider_capabilities` uses these to decide eligibility (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/ModelRuntimeRequirements.swift`, `coordinator/registry/provider_capabilities.go`) |
| M6 | `.m6` | Uses a conservative 153 GB/s nominal bandwidth and the 4-token MTP rectangle limit until physically qualified; a passing NAX diagnostic can advertise `mlx_nax`, but M6 does not claim the M5-specific `apple_m5` capability (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Hardware/HardwareDetector.swift`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/MTP/MTPAutomaticVerificationPolicy.swift`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/ModelRuntimeRequirements.swift`) |
| Other | `.unknown` | Treated like M1/M2 for MTP |

Chip tier (`Base`, `Pro`, `Max`, `Ultra`) is reported to the coordinator but
does not gate any model (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Hardware/HardwareDetector.swift`,
`parseChipIdentity`).

## New 2026 desktop identifiers

The base-reward catalog (`coordinator/hardware/mac_models.go`,
`ModelMaxMemoryGB`) includes the three unambiguous identifiers below. It
excludes the M5 Ultra's disputed identifier until the conflict is resolved.
This catalog does not bypass serving authorization, model requirements or the
provider load gate. Actual model serving still needs physical validation.

| Mac | Identifier | Maximum unified memory | Base-reward memory cap |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Mac mini, M6 | `Mac18,5` | 32 GB | 32 GB |
| Mac mini, M5 Pro | `Mac17,16` | 64 GB | 64 GB |
| Mac Studio, M5 Max | `Mac17,14` | 128 GB | 128 GB |
| Mac Studio, M5 Ultra | `Mac17,15` | 512 GB | Ineligible pending identifier confirmation |

Apple's [Mac mini identification page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102852)
currently prints `Mac17,15` for the M5 Pro mini, while its
[Mac Studio page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102231) prints that identifier
for the M5 Ultra Studio. An [M5 Pro mini benchmark submission](https://browser.geekbench.com/v7/cpu/425786)
reports `Mac17,16`. Confirm `hw.model` on a physical mini before relying on
its base-reward tier. `Mac17,15` remains unknown to the reward catalog so a
mini cannot inherit the Ultra's 512 GB cap; this does not block the Studio
from enrolling or serving otherwise eligible models.

## RAM tiers and catalog models

Which model loads on a given Mac is decided twice: the coordinator routes only
to boxes whose total memory is at least the catalog's `min_ram_gb`
(`coordinator/registry/scheduler.go`, `modelFitsHardware`), and the provider
then requires, at load time, free memory of at least the model's padded weights
plus its activation reserve plus the minimum KV headroom
(`requiredToLoadGb`, [load gate](../architecture/hardware-support.md#load-gate-modelloadadmission)).
The table applies the provider's rule to the live catalog as recorded on
2026-08-30 ([`../reports/2026-08-30-activation-floor-measurements.md`](../reports/2026-08-30-activation-floor-measurements.md),
"Live catalog"); `min_ram_gb` and `size_gb` are catalog data, not code, so
re-read them from `darkbloom models catalog` before relying on a row.

| Catalog id | Catalog `min_ram_gb` | Weights `size_gb` | Activation reserve | Provider needs free at load (GiB) | Smallest Mac where an idle box passes the provider gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gpt-oss-20b` | 24 | 12.1 | measured floor | 18.0 | 24 GB (tight) |
| `gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit` | 36 | 15.6 | default | 23.9 | 32 GB |
| `qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct` | 32 | 18.3 | default | 27.0 | 32 GB (tight) |
| `qwen3.5-35b-a3b` | 36 | 20.9 | default | 29.9 | 36 GB |
| `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-vl-mtp-mxfp8` | 32 | 21.3 | default | 30.3 | 36 GB — does **not** load on a 32 GB Mac despite the catalog tier |
| `gemma-4-26b` (8bit) | 36 | 28.0 | default | 37.8 | 48 GB — does **not** load on a 36 GB Mac despite the catalog tier |
| `gemma-4-26b-8bit` | 64 | 28.0 | default | 37.8 | 48 GB |

How each column is computed: weights are the catalog `size_gb` padded by
`memoryOverheadFactor`; the activation reserve is
`UnifiedMemoryCap.defaultActivationReserveBytes`, or the model's entry in
`measuredActivationFloorsBytes` where one exists (today only `gpt-oss-20b`);
the load also needs `minimumLoadKVBytes` of KV headroom. The values of those
constants are in [`../architecture/hardware-support.md#constants`](../architecture/hardware-support.md#constants)
and the formulas in [Cap and reserves](../architecture/hardware-support.md#cap-and-reserves-unifiedmemorycap).
"Smallest Mac" assumes nothing else is loaded, the default `memory_reserve_gb`
([`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli))
and the default hard cap; "tight" means the system-available memory the gate
needs (the free-at-load figure plus the config reserve) is within 2 GiB of the
machine's total. The two rows marked **not** are the discrepancies the
2026-08-30 report recommends fixing in the catalog (re-tier
`qwen3.6-35b-a3b-vl-mtp-mxfp8` to 36; `gemma-4-26b` 8bit stays blocked at
padded weights until a provider-path residency measurement lands).

Several models can be resident at once, up to `max_model_slots`
([`cli-reference.md`](./cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli)):
each adds its padded weights, while the activation reserve is charged once at
the largest floor in the serving set. The KV cache for concurrent requests comes
out of whatever the cap leaves after weights and activations; a model that loads
with less than `minimumLoadKVBytes` of KV headroom is unloaded again
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/KVHeadroomProbe.swift`;
[after the load](../architecture/hardware-support.md#after-the-load)).

## Qwen4 learned-table offload

The [Flash-Next candidate](../reference/qwen4-next-support.md)
keeps learned PLE tables SSD-backed even when request prefix caching is off.
`Qwen4ExpMmapFootprint.excludedBytes` validates safetensor payload ranges before
subtracting offloaded bytes from the scanner's native-weight loading estimate
(`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Models/Qwen4ExpMmapFootprint.swift`).
Eligible native non-FP16 layouts also receive a header-derived load-copy
allowance through `Qwen4ExpLoadFootprint.estimate`; all vision and MTP weights
remain counted. Malformed or unsupported metadata retains the conservative
padding. See the [loading bound and retirement window](../architecture/hardware-support.md#mechanism).
The coordinator applies
the separate [offload declaration gate](../architecture/routing.md#ssd-offloaded-model-weights).

Mapped pages can still occupy reclaimable OS cache. Target KV, QSA index,
GDN/PLE state, MTP history, restore scratch and concurrent requests add live
allocations with their own owners. Arithmetic weight fit is not hardware
qualification: retaining native multimodal support and listing full native
context does not establish full-window operation on 128 GiB hardware. Existing catalog minimum RAM,
runtime headroom and actual capacity gates remain in force.

## Gemma QAT assistant footprint and availability

The v0.9.1 provider source defaults exact `gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit` to automatic
MTP and encrypted paged SSD prefix caching. Gemma 8-bit retains its existing
opt-in behavior. The dated RAM table above describes target loading; it does
not certify space for a concurrently staged assistant replacement.

| Resource or phase | Operator impact | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Assistant download | The pinned catalog assistant adds 236,127,665 bytes (about 236 MB) of files beside the target and SSD cache. This is artifact size, not a promise of loaded memory use; future catalog revisions may differ | [Pinned assistant file sizes](../reports/evidence/2026-09-08-gemma-qat-defaults/hf-assistant-identity-verification.json); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/SpecDec/SpecDecResolver.swift` (`SpecDecResolver`) |
| Replacement memory | Before preparation, reserve the assistant's resident-byte estimate plus the minimum serviceable KV grant (1 GiB) while the old engine remains resident. Existing activation/headroom reserves remain enforced; shared target weights are retained and counted once. Insufficient memory defers the optional upgrade without evicting a serving model | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+MTPUpgrade.swift` (`prepareMTPUpgrade`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/Memory/EngineV2Reslice.swift` (`EngineV2KVSizing.minimumServiceableGrantBytes`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/MTP/MTPStagingReservations.swift` (`extraBytes`) |
| Download, verification and preparation | The original engine continues serving. Missing or invalid artifacts and preparation failures preserve target-only serving | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/SpecDec/SpecDecArtifactFunnel.swift` (`prepare`); `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/MTP/MTPIdleUpgrade.swift` (`run`) |
| Prepared-engine activation | Network serving continues through the configured rollout jitter, then new admissions for this model close until accepted work finishes and the engine swaps. Other models remain eligible. Standalone skips fleet jitter; new acquisitions during either model drain can receive transient 503. Timeout/cancellation discards the candidate and reopens the original engine without force-cancelling accepted work | [Drain bounds, controls and failure behavior](../architecture/inference.md#multi-token-prediction); [`update_jitter_seconds`](cli-reference.md#providertoml-keys-read-by-the-cli) |

Jitter spreads independent network-provider upgrades; it does not reserve spare
fleet capacity or guarantee another provider remains available. Explicit MTP
off/kill controls preserve target-only decoding; the cache disable is separate.
See [exact model defaults](../consumer/models.md#gemma-4-26b-qat-runtime-defaults).

## Nemotron embedded assistant memory

Nemotron 3.5 Lightning retains native convolution/KV dtypes and FP32 persistent
Mamba SSM state. Embedded MTP adds request-local assistant KV/history plus
speculative target-state reservations; file size alone is not an admission
estimate. `NemotronH35MTPAssistant.requestStateBytesPerToken` conservatively
charges assistant pages/history, and ordinary runtime memory gates remain in force
(`libs/mlx-swift-lm/Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/NemotronH35MTP.swift`). Complete prefix
checkpoints preserve immutable trusted history and restore independent assistant
state. Captured verification and adaptive depth do not imply a qualified device tier.
See [engine MTP constraints](../architecture/inference.md#multi-token-prediction).

## Disk for the SSD prefix cache

| Rule | Where it is specified | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Location | [`../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#paths`](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#paths) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCacheFactory.swift` |
| Box-wide budget (`ssdDiskBudgetBytes`, based on currently available space), the `DARKBLOOM_PREFIX_CACHE_DISK_GB` override, LRU eviction | [`../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules`](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCache/PrefixCachePolicy.swift` (`ssdDiskBudgetBytes`) |
| Low-disk write stop (`lowDiskFloorBytes`; reads continue) and the daily write cap (`defaultMaxWriteBytesPerDay`) | [`../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules`](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#size-and-eviction-rules) | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/KVCacheSSD/SSDPrefixCachePolicy.swift` |
| When it is used at all | Exact `gpt-oss-20b` defaults to encrypted complete SSD caching with segmented paged storage; contiguous fallback serves cold. Eligible Qwen and selected Nemotron Lightning use complete SSD on native contiguous or segmented paged target storage; historical GPT-OSS/Gemma complete checkpoints require paged storage. Loaded capability, identity and key gates apply; resident RAM is opt-in | [`../architecture/prefix-cache.md`](../architecture/prefix-cache.md) |

## Storage

Model discovery and downloads share the [resolved Hugging Face hub cache](../reference/configuration.md#model-cache-location)
(`ModelScanner.resolveCache`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCoreFoundation/ModelScanner+CacheDirectory.swift`).
Use [`darkbloom models location`](cli-reference.md#darkbloom-models-location) to inspect
or choose an existing directory, including one on an external volume. Empty
directories are valid for future downloads; the command never moves existing
weights. `--check` lists discovered MLX model IDs without claiming integrity or
network eligibility. Existing providers keep their legacy cache until a location
is explicitly saved; ambient Hugging Face/XDG variables never override it.
`--from-env` is an explicit one-time import that pins the resolved directory.

After saving a location, use `darkbloom restart` (or `darkbloom start` if stopped)
to apply it. Mount external volumes first; a missing selected cache does not fall
back to another directory. No automatic weight movement or restart occurs.

Plan disk space per model from the catalog output of `darkbloom models catalog`.
Logs and telemetry are small; the bundle plus `mlx.metallib` is roughly 200 MB.

## Network

| Direction | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Outbound | `wss://api.darkbloom.dev/ws/provider` and `https://api.darkbloom.dev` on port 443 |
| Inbound | None for normal provider operation |
| Local | Optional: `darkbloom start --local` or `--local-endpoint` binds a loopback/tailnet address |

Persistent WebSocket idle bandwidth is low (heartbeat every 5 seconds by
default).

## Thermal and power

| Behaviour | Code |
|---|---|
| The daemon prevents system sleep while serving | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/ProcessLifecycle.swift` (`preventSystemSleep`) |
| Thermal state (`nominal`, `fair`, `serious`, `critical`) is sampled from `ProcessInfo.thermalState`, sent to the coordinator as `thermal_state`, and written to the daemon state file read by `darkbloom status` | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Hardware/SystemMetrics.swift`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Protocol/Types.swift`, `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Service/DaemonStateFile.swift` |
| Optional experimental fan control (Macs with a fan and a validated GPU sensor) | [`fan-control.md`](./fan-control.md) |
